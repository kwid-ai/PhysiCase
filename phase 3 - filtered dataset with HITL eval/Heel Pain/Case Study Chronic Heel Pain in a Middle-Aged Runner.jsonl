    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Heel Pain in a Middle-Aged Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. William Anderson is a 47-year-old recreational runner who presents with an insidious onset of right heel pain over the last 3 months. He first noticed discomfort in the mornings upon getting out of bed, characterized by a sharp, stabbing pain localized at the bottom of his right heel. The pain diminishes after a few minutes of walking but recurs after periods of rest and intensifies during prolonged activities, particularly after running. He runs approximately 20-25 kilometers per week, and has recently increased his mileage in preparation for a local half marathon. He reports taking over-the-counter painkillers with partial relief. He denies any history of direct trauma to the heel.",

    "easing_factors": "Rest, ice application post-activity, wearing cushioned shoes with good arch support, brief stretching of the calf and plantar fascia, over-the-counter NSAIDs.",

Resides with spouse and two teenage children. He describes himself as generally active with a busy work and family life. Has been more motivated to exercise since his last medical checkup revealed slightly raised cholesterol levels.",
