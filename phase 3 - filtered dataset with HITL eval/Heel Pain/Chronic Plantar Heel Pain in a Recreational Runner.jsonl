    "title": "Chronic Plantar Heel Pain in a Recreational Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. James Taylor is a 42-year-old accountant who presents with a 6-month history of insidious onset right heel pain. He reports that the pain is sharp and most pronounced with his first steps in the morning or after periods of prolonged sitting. The pain eases somewhat with continued walking but returns after long periods of standing, walking, or running. In recent weeks, the pain has gradually worsened, forcing him to reduce his usual three weekly 5km runs. He notes increased discomfort at his desk job after walking to and from the parking lot and climbing stairs. There is no history of recent trauma to the ankle or foot. James has no systemic symptoms such as fever or night sweats.",
