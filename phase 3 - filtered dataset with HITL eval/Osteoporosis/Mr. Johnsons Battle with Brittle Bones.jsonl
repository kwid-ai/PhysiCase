    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Battle with Brittle Bones",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Richard Johnson, 72, is a retired carpenter who arrived at the clinic following a low-impact fall in his garden. He reports widespread bone pain, especially in the lumbar spine and hips, making daily activities challenging. A recent DXA scan confirmed he has osteoporosis. He recalls having lost 1.5 inches in height over the past few years and has a history of backaches that he attributed to 'old age' and his prior occupation. There is also a newly present kyphosis, giving him a slightly hunched back, more noticeable in the past year.",

    "past_history": "No major illnesses or conditions reported in the past. Worked as a carpenter for 40 years. Played recreational squash until the age of 55.",
    "medical_history": "Hypertension controlled with medication, occasional heartburn. Family history reveals his mother also dealt with osteoporosis.",
    "medications": "Currently on alendronate (Fosamax) once weekly for osteoporosis, calcium and vitamin D supplements daily, amlodipine for blood pressure.",
    "personal_history": "Widower, living alone. His two children live out of town. Enjoys reading, bird-watching and tending to his garden in his spare time.",
    "imaging": "Recently conducted DXA scan showed significant reduction in bone mineral density, aligning with a T-score of -2.6 in the lumbar spine.",
