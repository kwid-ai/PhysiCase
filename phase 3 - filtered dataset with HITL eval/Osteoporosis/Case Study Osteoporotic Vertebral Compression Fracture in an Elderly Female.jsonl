    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Judith Evans is a 72-year-old retired librarian who presented with a three-week history of worsening lower thoracic and lumbar back pain, following an episode of bending forward to lift a light box of books. She reports a dull, persistent ache across her lower back, with occasional sharp pain when changing positions. She denies any history of trauma or significant falls. Upon further questioning, Judith mentions that she has lost approximately 2 cm in height over the past year and occasionally notices that her posture is becoming stooped. There is no history of fever, weight loss, or neurological symptoms. Judith struggles to stand for long periods or walk more than 10-15 minutes due to pain, but is most uncomfortable when rising from a seated position or attempting light housework. She lives alone and relies on her daughter for more strenuous chores. Judith\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s physical examination reveals local tenderness over the lower thoracic and upper lumbar vertebrae, with visible kyphosis. No neurological deficits are elicited.",
