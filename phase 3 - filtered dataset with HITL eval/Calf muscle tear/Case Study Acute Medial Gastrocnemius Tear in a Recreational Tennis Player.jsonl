    "title": "Case Study: Acute Medial Gastrocnemius Tear in a Recreational Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "James, a 44-year-old accountant and recreational tennis player, experienced a sudden, sharp pain in his left calf while pushing off during a serve two days ago. He immediately had to stop playing and noticed swelling and bruising developing along the medial calf over the next few hours. He now reports significant difficulty walking, particularly with weight-bearing on the affected side, and describes sensations of tightness, weakness, and localized tenderness. His sleep is interrupted at night with throbbing in the calf, especially after periods of inactivity. There is no history of trauma, and he denies any prior significant injuries to the lower limb.",
