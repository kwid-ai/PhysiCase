    "title": "The Recreational Athlete's Misstep: A Case of an Uncomplicated Boxer's Fracture",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. David Chen, a 42-year-old financial analyst, presents to your outpatient clinic with a referral for physical therapy. A fortnight ago, while playing in a recreational flag football league, he tripped and fell awkwardly onto his outstretched right hand, with his fist clenched. He reported an immediate, sharp pain and visible swelling over the ulnar border of his hand. He presented to an urgent care center the same day where radiographs were taken. He was diagnosed with a fracture of the 5th metacarpal, placed in an ulnar gutter splint, and instructed to remain non-weight-bearing through the hand. He now presents for therapy to address pain, swelling, and progressive loss of motion, expressing concern about his ability to return to work tasks which involve significant typing and writing.",

    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Attempting to make a fist, gripping objects (e.g., coffee mug, steering wheel), writing or typing for more than a few minutes, pushing up from a chair, any direct pressure or percussion over the fracture site.",
    "picture": "Pain (P1) is localized over the dorsal aspect of the right hand, specifically at the head and neck of the 5th metacarpal bone (the 'knuckle' of the little finger). Swelling is evident in this area. Stiffness and secondary ache (P2) is felt throughout the 4th and 5th fingers and the ulnar aspect of the wrist.",
    "easing_factors": "Rest, elevation of the hand above the heart, wearing the protective splint, and intermittent use of cold packs.",
    "past_history": "Generally unremarkable. He sustained a Grade I inversion sprain to his left ankle approximately 5 years ago which resolved fully with rest and a home exercise program.",
    "medical_history": "Patient is in good health. No known chronic illnesses or significant medical conditions. Reports a seasonal allergy for which he takes over-the-counter medication.",
    "medications": "Ibuprofen 400mg, one tablet every 6-8 hours as needed for pain. Loratadine 10mg daily for seasonal allergies.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Chen is right-hand dominant. He works full-time as a financial analyst, a desk job that requires extensive computer use. He is married with one child. He is an active individual who enjoys flag football and cycling. He is motivated to regain full function to return to his job without limitation and resume his sporting activities.",
    "imaging": "Plain film radiographs (X-rays) of the right hand performed 14 days prior confirmed an uncomplicated, closed, non-displaced fracture of the neck of the fifth metacarpal.",
