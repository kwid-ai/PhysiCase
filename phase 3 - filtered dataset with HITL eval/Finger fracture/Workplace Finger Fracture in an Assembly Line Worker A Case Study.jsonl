    "title": "Workplace Finger Fracture in an Assembly Line Worker: A Case Study",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Ravi Sharma, a 43-year-old right-handed factory assembly line worker, presents with acute pain and swelling of his left ring finger. The injury occurred 3 days ago when his finger was caught between two conveyor components at his workplace. He reports immediate sharp pain, significant swelling, and difficulty moving the affected digit. Since the incident, Mr. Sharma notes persistent tenderness and trouble gripping objects with his left hand, which is now interfering with both work tasks and daily activities such as buttoning his shirt. There is mild bruising along the dorsal aspect of the proximal phalanx, and he reports that touching or bumping the finger exacerbates the pain. No other injuries or systemic symptoms are reported.",
