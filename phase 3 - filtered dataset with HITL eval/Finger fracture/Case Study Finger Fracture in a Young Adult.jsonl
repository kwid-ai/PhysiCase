    "clinical_history": "A 25-year-old right-handed graphic designer, Sarah, presented to the clinic with a complaint of pain and swelling in her left index finger. She reported that she had fallen onto her outstretched hand while walking down the stairs 2 days ago. She noticed immediate pain and swelling in her finger, which has been persistent since then. She has difficulty moving her finger and has been experiencing pain when trying to extend it.",
