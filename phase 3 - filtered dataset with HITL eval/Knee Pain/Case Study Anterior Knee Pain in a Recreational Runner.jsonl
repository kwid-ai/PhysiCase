    "title": "Case Study: Anterior Knee Pain in a Recreational Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Rahul Sharma is a 36-year-old software engineer and recreational runner who presents with a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain in his right knee. The pain initially started as a mild discomfort after completing his regular 5k runs but has since progressed to persistent aching, especially during and after physical activity. Rahul reports increased pain with prolonged sitting (\"movie sign\"), stair descent, and squatting. He denies locking, significant swelling, or giving way but describes occasional crepitus. There is no history of trauma, surgery, or previous major knee injuries. On assessment, tenderness is noted over the patellofemoral joint with mild swelling and pain on resisted knee extension.",
