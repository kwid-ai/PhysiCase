    "clinical_history": "John T., a 22-year-old male university track athlete, presented to the clinic with severe muscle pain and profound weakness in both thighs and calves following a marathon conducted under atypically hot and humid conditions three days prior. He reports dark, tea-colored urine beginning the morning after the race and progressive inability to walk without assistance. He describes significant swelling in his lower limbs and generalized fatigue. He recalls consuming little water during the event. Denies recent trauma, new medication, or viral illness.",
