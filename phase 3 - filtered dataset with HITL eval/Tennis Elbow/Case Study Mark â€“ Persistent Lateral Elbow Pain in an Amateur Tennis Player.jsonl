    "title": "Case Study: Mark \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Persistent Lateral Elbow Pain in an Amateur Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 42-year-old office worker and keen amateur tennis player who presents with a 4-week history of progressive pain over the outer aspect of his right elbow. He reports that the pain started gradually during a period when he increased his tennis matches from twice weekly to four times weekly in preparation for a local tournament. He specifically notes pain with gripping his tennis racquet, particularly during backhand strokes, and also experiences discomfort when lifting objects such as a kettle or briefcase. Pain is exacerbated after practice sessions and tends to linger for hours afterward. There is occasional mild swelling over the lateral elbow, but no pins and needles or numbness. He denies previous injuries to the area, though he did experience a similar but self-resolving episode two years ago, which settled with rest. Mark has tried over-the-counter ibuprofen with some relief but continues to play tennis. He is otherwise well and has no significant medical conditions.",
