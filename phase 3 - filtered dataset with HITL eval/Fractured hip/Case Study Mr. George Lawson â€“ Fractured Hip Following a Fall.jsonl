    "clinical_history": "Mr. George Lawson is an 81-year-old retired postal worker who lives independently. He was admitted to the emergency department following a mechanical fall at home. Mr. Lawson tripped over a rug in his hallway and landed directly on his left side. He immediately experienced severe left hip pain and was unable to bear weight. In the emergency room, physical examination revealed shortening and external rotation of the left lower limb. There was marked tenderness over the left hip and decreased range of motion due to pain. Radiographs confirmed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur.",

    "easing_factors": "Immobilization, positioning with pillows to support the limb, regular administration of opioids and acetaminophen, application of ice, and minimal movement. Slight relief with limb elevation.",
