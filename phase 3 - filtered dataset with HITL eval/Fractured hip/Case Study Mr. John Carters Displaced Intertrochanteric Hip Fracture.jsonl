    "title": "Case Study: Mr. John Carter's Displaced Intertrochanteric Hip Fracture",
    "clinical_history": "John Carter is a 78-year-old retired factory worker who presented to the emergency department following a slip and fall on his kitchen floor. He immediately experienced severe left hip pain and was unable to bear weight. Emergency medical services found him lying supine, with the left leg shortened and externally rotated. He reports a history of occasional dizziness, most recently a week prior to the fall. On examination, the affected hip is tender to palpation, with marked restrictions in active and passive movement and significant guarding due to pain. Radiographs confirm a displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur. He is scheduled for surgical fixation.",
