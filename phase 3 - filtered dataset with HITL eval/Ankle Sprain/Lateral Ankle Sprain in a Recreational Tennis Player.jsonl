    "title": "Lateral Ankle Sprain in a Recreational Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. James Turner is a 34-year-old recreational tennis player who sustained a right ankle injury 3 days ago during a doubles match. While reaching for a wide shot, he landed awkwardly on the lateral edge of his right foot, experiencing an immediate rolling sensation and a 'pop.' He was unable to continue playing and noted swelling on the lateral aspect of the ankle within 30 minutes. He has been managing with rest, ice, compression, and elevation since the incident. He reports ongoing pain and difficulty weight-bearing, especially during the first steps on waking and when climbing stairs. There is no history of previous significant ankle injuries. Mr. Turner is otherwise healthy and trains recreationally 2-3 times a week.",
