    "title": "Lateral Ankle Sprain Following Recreational Soccer: The Case of Mr. Thomas Evans",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Thomas Evans is a 32-year-old accountant and amateur soccer player with no significant medical comorbidities. He presented to the outpatient physical therapy department 3 days after sustaining an injury to his right ankle during a weekend league match. He reports landing awkwardly as he attempted to pivot and change direction while running, resulting in an immediate inversion of the right foot. He describes hearing a 'pop' and feeling sharp pain along the outside of his ankle, followed by swelling and difficulty bearing weight. He was unable to continue playing. Since the injury, he reports persistent lateral ankle pain, swelling, mild bruising, and a sensation of instability. He is ambulatory with a limp, has not returned to sport, and utilizes ice and over-the-counter ibuprofen for pain management.",
