    "title": "Case Study: Rehabilitation Challenges in a Transfemoral Amputee \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Mr. John Proctor",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Proctor is a 48-year-old male, formerly employed as a construction site foreman, who underwent a left transfemoral (above-knee) amputation 7 months ago following a severe workplace accident involving a heavy machinery crush injury. Since the amputation, Mr. Proctor reports persistent pain and decreased mobility, despite the use of a custom-fitted prosthesis. His primary complaint is distal thigh stump pain (P1), ranging from deep aching to occasional sharp, burning sensations, particularly after periods of prosthetic use or prolonged ambulation. He also describes secondary low back pain (P2), which he attributes to altered gait mechanics and prolonged use of crutches prior to receiving his prosthesis. Mr. Proctor is motivated to regain independence but has noted increasing frustration with residual limb discomfort, phantom limb sensations, and difficulty sleeping.",
