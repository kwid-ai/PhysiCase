    "title": "Rehabilitation of a Transfemoral Amputee: The Case of Mr. John Carter",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Carter is a 48-year-old construction worker who underwent an above-knee (transfemoral) amputation of his right leg six months ago following a traumatic worksite accident involving a heavy machinery rollover. He reports residual limb pain and significant discomfort at the distal end of the stump, particularly after prolonged use of his prosthesis. He also complains of phantom limb sensations, describing intermittent sharp pain and tingling perceived in his absent foot. Mr. Carter presents for a physical therapy consultation with the primary goal of improving his mobility, optimizing prosthetic use, and managing his pain.",

    "easing_factors": "Removing prosthesis for rest, gentle stump massage, use of a heated pad, and over-the-counter acetaminophen. Engages in relaxation exercises for phantom pain.",
    "past_history": "No prior musculoskeletal injuries to the lower limbs. No significant medical comorbidities prior to the accident. Occasional back discomfort due to years of manual labor.",
    "medical_history": "Otherwise healthy. No diabetes, vascular disease, or prior surgeries. No history of depression, though recent mood changes have been noted post-amputation.",
    "medications": "Acetaminophen 500 mg PRN for pain; Gabapentin 100 mg daily for phantom limb pain (recently prescribed); Topical antibiotic ointment applied to residual limb to reduce risk of infection.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with his wife and two teenage children in a single-story home. Was the primary income earner prior to his accident. Enjoyed recreational cycling and hiking before injury. Mild to moderate difficulty adjusting psychologically to loss of limb and changes to body image; expresses interest in returning to adapted sports.",
    "imaging": "Postoperative X-ray confirmed appropriate femoral stump length and soft tissue coverage with no heterotopic ossification; recent ultrasound showed no evidence of residual limb infection or deep vein thrombosis.",
