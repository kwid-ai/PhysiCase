    "title": "Mrs. Wilsonâ€™s Progressive Arthritic Knee: A Case Analysis",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Evelyn Wilson is a 63-year-old retired librarian who presents with a 5-year history of right knee pain, gradually worsening over the past year. She describes the pain as a deep ache with intermittent episodes of sharp catching sensations, particularly noticeable upon rising from a seated position and during ambulation. Stiffness is worst in the mornings and after prolonged periods of inactivity, while swelling develops after longer walks or household activities. She reports a reduction in her walking distance, increasing reliance on handrails when negotiating stairs, and difficulty kneeling or squatting. Mrs. Wilson reports disturbed sleep due to discomfort when changing positions at night. No history of recent trauma is noted, though she underwent an appendectomy at age 20 and has a longstanding diagnosis of hypertension.",
