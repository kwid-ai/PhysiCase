    "clinical_history": "Mr. Albert Jenkins is a 68-year-old male and a retired postmaster. He presents with a 7-year history of gradually worsening right knee pain and stiffness, most notable over the last year. The discomfort started insidiously, initially with mild stiffness in the mornings that would resolve after a few minutes of ambulation. The pain has progressively increased, now affecting his ability to walk his dog daily and participate in his local gardening club. He describes periods of increased pain and swelling, particularly following prolonged standing or after long walks. Night pain occasionally disturbs his sleep, though only after particularly active days. He reports associated crepitus and a sensation of 'grinding' within the joint but denies locking, catching, or giving way. No recent trauma is reported. Mr. Jenkins expresses frustration about reliance on analgesics and reduced participation in social and physical activities.",
