    "title": "Jake's Battle with Bell's Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "Jake is a 34-year-old IT consultant who woke up one morning to find that he couldn't move the right side of his face. He looked in the mirror and noticed that his right eye wouldn't fully close, and there was drooping at the corner of his mouth. This onset, sudden and without clear precipitating factors, was paired with mild ear pain the night prior, which he attributed to sleeping by an open window. Previously in good health, Jake was shocked by the sudden facial weakness, his speech slightly slurred, and his complete lack of blink on the affected side. He denied any numbness, a headache of significance, or visual changes.",
