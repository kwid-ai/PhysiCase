    "title": "Acute Onset Facial Asymmetry in a Middle-Aged Male: Bell's Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Ravi Sharma is a 48-year-old accountant who presented to the outpatient clinic with a sudden onset of right-sided facial weakness that developed overnight. He first noticed difficulty in closing his right eyelid and an inability to smile symmetrically when looking in the mirror. He also reported dribbling of liquids when attempting to drink, mild pain around his right mastoid, and increased sensitivity to loud sounds on the affected side. He denies any trauma, recent infections, or similar prior events. No limb weakness or change in speech noticed. Past week, he experienced a mild upper respiratory tract infection that resolved without medication.",
