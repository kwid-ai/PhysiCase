    "title": "John: Acute Left-Sided Bell's Palsy with Facial Motor Deficits",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 42-year-old right-handed IT manager who presented acutely to his GP with a sudden onset of facial weakness on the left side, which he noticed on waking up two days ago. He reported an inability to close his left eye fully, drooping of the left corner of his mouth, and difficulty pronouncing certain words. He denies head trauma or recent dental work. Sensory function is largely intact, though he has complained of mild aching near his left ear and reported an altered taste in the left half of his tongue. John reports no vesicular rash or hearing loss. He reports increased tearing from his left eye and food occasionally dribbling from the left half of his mouth when eating.",
