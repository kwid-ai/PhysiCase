    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Lateral Epicondylitis (Tennis Elbow) in an Amateur Golfer",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Thomas Jenkins is a 42-year-old right-handed investment banker and recreational golfer presenting with a 6-week history of progressive pain and tenderness localized over the lateral aspect of his right elbow. The onset was insidious, noticed initially after a weekend tournament where he played 27 holes on consecutive days. Since then, he reports persistent aching and occasional sharp pain, particularly with gripping his golf club, shaking hands, or lifting objects such as a coffee mug. He denies any preceding trauma, swelling, or numbness. Mr. Jenkins continues to play golf weekly, trying to 'play through the pain', but notes increasing difficulty and decreased performance due to discomfort.",
