    "title": "Progressive Mobility Decline in an Elderly Patient with Alzheimer Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Bernard Grant is a 78-year-old retired accountant brought to clinic by his daughter due to increasing difficulty with daily mobility and frequent falls over the past six months. The daughter notes he is experiencing confusion, forgetfulness, and recently left the stove on unattended. Mr. Grant previously walked independently but now requires a walker due to instability and weakness, particularly in the lower limbs. He has developed a shuffling gait, struggles to initiate steps, and complains of muscle stiffness, particularly in the thighs and calves (P1). Occasionally, he reports aching pain in his lower back (P2). He is slow to rise from a chair and is easily fatigued. There is marked atrophy of the quadriceps and reduced tone in the gluteal muscles on examination. The daughter expresses concern about periods of increased vocalization of pain, especially during transfers and in the evening.",

    "easing_factors": "Supervised rest in a reclined position, warm compress on lower limbs, caregiver-assisted mobility, calm and well-lit environment",
    "past_history": "History of hypertension and mild osteoarthritis. No previous history of neurological conditions. Fall six months ago resulting in minor wrist sprain, since then progressive mobility decline.",
    "medical_history": "Diagnosed Alzheimer disease two years prior; hypertension managed with medication; mild osteoarthritis of knees for past 5 years",
    "medications": "Donepezil 10 mg daily, Lisinopril 10 mg daily, Acetaminophen 650 mg as needed for pain (up to twice daily)",
    "personal_history": "Lives with his daughter, widowed for 4 years, previously independent with ADLs, stopped driving a year ago due to cognitive decline, limited socialization outside family",
    "imaging": "Recent MRI brain confirms global cerebral atrophy with prominent involvement of the hippocampi; no acute infarct or hemorrhage. No lower limb or spinal imaging to date.",
