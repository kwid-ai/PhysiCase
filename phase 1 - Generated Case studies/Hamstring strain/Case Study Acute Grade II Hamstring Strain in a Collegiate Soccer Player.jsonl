    "title": "Case Study: Acute Grade II Hamstring Strain in a Collegiate Soccer Player",
    "clinical_history": "Michael is a 20-year-old male collegiate soccer player (midfielder) who presents with acute onset of left posterior thigh pain. The injury occurred 2 days ago during a competitive match. He was accelerating into a full sprint to chase a loose ball when he felt a sudden, sharp 'popping' sensation in the back of his left thigh. The pain was immediate and severe, causing him to pull up and fall to the ground. He was unable to continue playing and was assisted off the field by the athletic trainer. He reports immediate difficulty with weight-bearing and a significant limp. Over the next 24 hours, he noted progressive swelling and the development of ecchymosis (bruising) extending down the back of his thigh towards the knee. His primary complaint (P1) is a sharp, localized pain in the mid-belly of his left hamstring, with a secondary ache (P2) in his left gluteal region from altered gait mechanics.",

    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Walking for more than 5-10 minutes, ascending/descending stairs, attempting to jog or run, active knee flexion against resistance, passive knee extension (straightening the leg), forward bending (touching toes), prolonged sitting (especially in a low chair), and pressing the gas/clutch pedal while driving.",
    "picture": "[insert image of a person highlighting the posterior thigh, specifically the biceps femoris, semitendinosus, and semimembranosus muscles, with bruising indicated]",
    "easing_factors": "Rest with the leg elevated, application of ice pack (20 minutes every 2 hours), gentle compression with a thigh sleeve, and using crutches to offload the leg.",
    "past_history": "History of a minor Grade I left hamstring strain approximately 18 months ago, during the previous season. He received brief treatment from the team's athletic trainer but admits he did not complete the full strengthening protocol as the season ended and the pain resolved with rest.",
    "medical_history": "Generally fit and well. No other musculoskeletal injuries. No known allergies. All immunizations are up to date.",
    "medications": "Taking Ibuprofen 400mg, 3 times per day for the past 2 days.",
    "personal_history": "Full-time student on a soccer scholarship, studying Kinesiology. Lives in a dormitory on campus. He is highly motivated to return to play as soon as possible due to an upcoming championship tournament. He denies smoking but reports occasional social alcohol use with teammates.",
    "imaging": "None to date. Clinical diagnosis is a Grade II hamstring strain. An MRI would be considered if there is suspicion of a full-thickness tear (Grade III) or avulsion fracture, or if progress stalls.",
