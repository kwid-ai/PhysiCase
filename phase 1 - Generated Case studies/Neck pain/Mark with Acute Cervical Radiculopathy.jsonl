    "title": "Mark with Acute Cervical Radiculopathy",
    "clinical_history": "Mark, a 42-year-old software developer, presents with a 3-week history of right-sided neck and arm pain. The onset was gradual, with no specific incident of trauma. He reports spending long hours at his desk over the past two months to meet a project deadline, often working 10-12 hours a day with poor ergonomic setup. Initially, he noticed a dull ache and stiffness in his neck (P1), which he attributed to fatigue. However, over the last week, the symptoms have progressed to include radiating pain, tingling, and intermittent numbness down his right arm, extending to his thumb and index finger (P2). He finds it difficult to maintain concentration at work due to the persistent discomfort. Activities like checking his blind spot while driving or looking down at his phone have become markedly painful.",
