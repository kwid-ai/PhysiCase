    "clinical_history": "Mr. Ajay Kumar is a 43-year-old office administrator who presents with a 5-month history of insidious onset neck pain. He has been working from home since the pandemic, often spending long hours at a poorly set-up workstation. The pain is described as a deep, aching discomfort localized to the lower cervical spine and right upper trapezius, sometimes radiating to the right shoulder. He reports morning stiffness lasting 30-40 minutes, which gradually improves as the day progresses. The pain intensifies through the workday, especially during prolonged screen time or when on calls, and is occasionally associated with mild headaches. He denies any trauma, numbness, or weakness in the upper limb. He reports that his symptoms are worse while driving and after stressful workdays. He tried over-the-counter paracetamol with mild, temporary relief. Sleep quality has declined due to discomfort with certain pillow positions.",
