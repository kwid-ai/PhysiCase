    "condition": "Neck pain",
    "title": "Chronic Mechanical Neck Pain in a Desk Worker",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Jonathan Lee is a 43-year-old accountant who presents with a 5-month history of insidious onset neck pain. He reports a persistent dull ache in the central and right posterior neck, radiating occasionally to the right upper trapezius and interscapular region. The symptoms started gradually, coinciding with increased work-related desk hours during tax season (12+ hours daily, high computer use). No specific traumatic incident is recalled. He experiences morning stiffness lasting 15-20 minutes and notes his pain worsens toward the end of the workday. There is no associated numbness or tingling in the arms, no headache, vertigo, or visual symptoms. He feels his neck is 'tight' and sometimes 'clicks' on movement. He recently began avoiding recreational tennis due to discomfort on quick head turns.",
