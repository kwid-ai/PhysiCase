    "title": "Chronic Low Back Pain in a Manual Laborer: The Case of Mr. Robert H.",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Robert H., a 48-year-old warehouse worker, presents with a 6-month history of persistent low back pain. The pain began insidiously after several months of increased overtime shifts requiring frequent lifting and prolonged stooping. He describes a deep, aching discomfort centralized over the lumbar spine, occasionally radiating to the right buttock (but not below the knee). He rates his primary pain as moderate to severe, worse by the end of his workday. He reports associated morning stiffness lasting up to 30 minutes and periodic sleep disruption due to discomfort when rolling in bed. The pain intensity fluctuates with activity levels, and he notes that it tends to increase with prolonged standing, lifting heavy objects, or forward bending. Sitting with adequate back support or lying supine with knees bent provides some relief. He has no lower limb weakness, numbness, or changes in bowel/bladder function.",
