    "title": "Chronic Low Back Pain in an Office Worker: A Case of Lumbar Dysfunction",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Thomas Lee is a 47-year-old accountant who presents with a 9-month history of persistent low back pain, gradually worsening over time. The pain first began after a period of prolonged sitting during end-of-year tax season, where he was working up to 12 hours a day at his desk. He describes the pain as a constant, dull ache across the lower lumbar region, occasionally radiating into his right gluteal area. He denies any traumatic injury, but notes morning stiffness for up to 30 minutes that eases with movement. He occasionally experiences sharp pain when bending forward to lift objects or when transitioning from sitting to standing. The pain interferes with his ability to focus at work and he has avoided most physical activities due to fear of aggravating his symptoms.",
