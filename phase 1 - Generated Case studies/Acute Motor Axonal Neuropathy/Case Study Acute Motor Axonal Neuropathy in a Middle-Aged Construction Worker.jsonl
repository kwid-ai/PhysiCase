    "title": "Case Study: Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy in a Middle-Aged Construction Worker",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Takeda is a 48-year-old male who works as a foreman in the construction industry. Approximately 12 days ago, he experienced a sudden onset of symmetrical weakness in his lower limbs, progressing rapidly to involve his upper limbs. Three days prior to symptom onset, he had a mild gastrointestinal infection with loose bowel movements and cramping, which resolved spontaneously. He reports difficulty climbing stairs, frequent tripping, and an inability to lift his arms above shoulder level. There is minimal sensory disturbance, but he notes severe muscle fatigue. No visual, speech, or swallowing difficulties. On examination, marked flaccid paralysis is present in both lower limbs, especially the anterior tibialis and quadriceps, with significant weakness in the upper limb flexors. Deep tendon reflexes are absent throughout. Cranial nerves are intact. He was hospitalized for observation as symptoms escalated over 48 hours.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Fatigue and muscle aching worsen with movement or attempts at walking. Prolonged sitting amplifies lower limb numbness. Emotional stress reported to increase perception of weakness.",

    "easing_factors": "Complete rest, assisted limb positioning, and supportive devices (ankle-foot orthotics).",
    "past_history": "No significant neurological or musculoskeletal issues previously. Normal functional mobility prior to this episode.",
    "medical_history": "No diabetes, hypertension, or chronic illness. No recent trauma or surgeries.",
    "medications": "Started on IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2g/kg for 5 days on hospital admission. Low-dose gabapentin for discomfort, paracetamol as needed.",
    "personal_history": "Married, living with spouse and two teenage children. Smoker (10 pack-years), moderate alcohol use. No illicit drug use. Strong social support network at home.",
    "imaging": "Nerve conduction studies revealed reduced compound muscle action potentials (CMAPs) with relative preservation of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), consistent with acute motor axonal neuropathy. No abnormalities on MRI brain and spine.",
