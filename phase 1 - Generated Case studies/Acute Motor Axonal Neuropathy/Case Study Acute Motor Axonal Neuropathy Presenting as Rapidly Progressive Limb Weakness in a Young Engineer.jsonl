    "title": "Case Study: Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy Presenting as Rapidly Progressive Limb Weakness in a Young Engineer",
    "clinical_history": "Rohan M., a 29-year-old male software engineer, presented to the outpatient neurology clinic with a 6-day history of progressive weakness in both legs and arms. He first noticed difficulty climbing stairs and rising from a chair, which progressed to marked difficulty in lifting his arms to comb his hair over the next 48 hours. There was no facial weakness or sensory loss, but he did notice that his grip was weaker and he struggled to open bottles. There was no bowel or bladder involvement. He reported tingling in his fingers initially but denied significant numbness. Two weeks prior, he had a severe gastrointestinal infection with diarrhea lasting 3 days. Examination revealed marked flaccid weakness (Medical Research Council grade 2-3/5 proximally and 3/5 distally in both upper and lower limbs), decreased deep tendon reflexes, but intact sensation. There was no cranial nerve involvement or respiratory distress.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Attempting to stand from sitting, climbing stairs, lifting arms above head, prolonged walking. Weakness intensifies by late afternoon.",
    "picture": "[Illustration of symmetric limb weakness, more marked proximally, affecting both upper and lower limbs. Reduced muscle bulk in proximal thighs and upper arms.]",
    "easing_factors": "Rest; supine positioning provides temporary relief from perceived effort, though does not resolve weakness.",
    "past_history": "No previous neurological deficits. No known history of trauma or hereditary neuromuscular disorders.",
    "medical_history": "Unremarkable; mild asthma as a child, no ongoing treatments.",
    "medications": "No routine medications. Received oral rehydration and a short course of loperamide during GI illness 2 weeks prior.",
    "personal_history": "Non-smoker, occasional alcohol use, lives alone. Family history non-contributory. Active lifestyle prior to current illness, employed as a software engineer.",
    "imaging": "Nerve conduction studies: Evidence of reduced motor amplitudes with preserved sensory responses, consistent with AMAN subtype of GBS. No structural abnormalities on spinal MRI.",
