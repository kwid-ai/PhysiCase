    "title": "John with a sudden case of Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 38-year-old construction worker who presented to the clinic with rapidly progressive weakness in his lower extremities. Approximately one week prior, John experienced a mild upper respiratory infection which he believes is unrelated. His symptoms began three days ago with tingling and weakness in his feet that quickly progressed to his calves and thighs. By today, he cannot walk without help and has difficulty lifting his arms. He reports no sensory loss nor changes in bowel or bladder function. John is very concerned as his symptoms have escalated rapidly, and he has noticed significant muscle wasting in a short amount of time.",
