    "title": "John's Battle with Persistent Heel Pain",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 45-year-old construction worker. Approximately 3 months ago, he began experiencing a dull ache in his right heel after long working days standing on concrete surfaces. Initially, the pain was mild and only after work, but gradually it started persisting even during work hours. He now experiences sharp pain first thing in the morning upon waking and significant discomfort after periods of inactivity. He describes the pain (P1) as primarily located at the underside of the heel, sometimes radiating to the arch of his foot. John walks with a noticeable limp towards the end of his workday and has begun using a makeshift padding in his boots to alleviate discomfort.",
