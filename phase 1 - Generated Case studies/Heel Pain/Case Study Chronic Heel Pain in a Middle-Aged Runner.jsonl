    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Heel Pain in a Middle-Aged Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. William Anderson is a 47-year-old recreational runner who presents with an insidious onset of right heel pain over the last 3 months. He first noticed discomfort in the mornings upon getting out of bed, characterized by a sharp, stabbing pain localized at the bottom of his right heel. The pain diminishes after a few minutes of walking but recurs after periods of rest and intensifies during prolonged activities, particularly after running. He runs approximately 20-25 kilometers per week, and has recently increased his mileage in preparation for a local half marathon. He reports taking over-the-counter painkillers with partial relief. He denies any history of direct trauma to the heel.",
