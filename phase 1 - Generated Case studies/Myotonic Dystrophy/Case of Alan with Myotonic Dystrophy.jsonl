    "title": "Case of Alan with Myotonic Dystrophy",
    "clinical_history": "Alan is a 45-year-old software engineer who was diagnosed with Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 at the age of 30. He initially began experiencing excessive daytime sleepiness and noticed difficulty relaxing his grip after holding objects. Alan's handwriting deteriorated gradually, and he found himself frequently tripping over his own feet. Despite the symptoms, he remained active and continued to work full-time. Over the past several years, Alan has experienced progressive muscle weakness, especially in his hands, forearms, and calves, along with facial muscle weakness leading to drooping eyelids and a noticeable facial thinning. He complains of difficulty swallowing and has a noticeable slur in his speech at times.",

    "past_history": "At age 28 he required an appendectomy, but otherwise, his past medical history is unremarkable until his myotonic dystrophy diagnosis.",
    "medical_history": "Progressive myotonia and muscle weakness documented over the past 15 years.",
    "medications": "Alan takes a muscle relaxant, Mexiletine, occasionally to reduce myotonia and Gabapentin to manage neuropathic pain.",
    "personal_history": "Alan is married and has two teenage children. His father was also diagnosed with the condition in his late 30s. Alan has adapted his work environment to include ergonomic tools and voice recognition software. He enjoys reading and has joined a local support group for individuals with neuromuscular diseases.",
    "imaging": "A muscle biopsy and genetic testing were used for initial diagnosis confirmation, but no recent imaging is available.",
