    "title": "Case Study: Functional Decline in a Patient with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. David Chen is a 48-year-old former architect who presents to your outpatient clinic with a referral from his neurologist for physical therapy evaluation and treatment. He was diagnosed with Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1) ten years ago, following genetic testing prompted by a family history (his mother was affected). Over the past decade, he has experienced a slow but steady progression of his symptoms, primarily characterized by distal muscle weakness, myotonia (difficulty relaxing his grip), and profound fatigue. He was forced to take an early retirement two years ago due to the difficulty with fine motor tasks required for drafting and computer work. His chief complaint today is a noticeable decline in his mobility and an increase in falls over the last six months. He reports tripping frequently, especially on uneven surfaces, and has significant difficulty climbing stairs. He also notes a deep, persistent aching in his forearms and lower legs (P1) and a more recent onset of intermittent low back pain (P2) after walking for more than 10-15 minutes.",

    "picture": "Body chart indicating primary symptoms in the facial muscles (ptosis), neck flexors, distal forearms/hands, and anterior lower legs (foot drop). Secondary pain is noted in the lumbar region.",
    "easing_factors": "Frequent, short rest periods. Pacing activities. Gentle stretching of hand and ankle musculature. Use of bilateral Ankle-Foot Orthoses (AFOs) for community ambulation (though he admits to inconsistent use due to discomfort). Warmth helps ease his myotonia.",
    "past_history": "Diagnosed with DM1 via genetic testing at age 38. History of two falls in the last six months, one resulting in a minor wrist sprain (no fracture). Previous course of PT five years ago focused on energy conservation strategies and a home exercise program, which he no longer follows regularly.",
    "medical_history": "Aside from DM1, he has been diagnosed with cataracts (common in DM1, surgically corrected last year), mild insulin resistance managed with diet, and subclinical hypothyroidism. He undergoes annual cardiac evaluation, including ECG and Holter monitoring, which currently shows sinus bradycardia but no significant conduction abnormalities.",
    "medications": "Mexiletine for myotonia, Modafinil for excessive daytime sleepiness, Levothyroxine. Does not regularly take analgesics.",
    "personal_history": "David lives with his wife in a two-story home. They are considering moving to a single-story residence due to his difficulty with stairs. He has a strong support system but expresses significant frustration and symptoms of depression related to his loss of independence and inability to pursue his hobbies, which included woodworking and playing the piano. He is currently unemployed.",
    "imaging": "No recent musculoskeletal imaging. An Electromyography (EMG) performed at the time of diagnosis demonstrated characteristic myotonic discharges. Genetic testing confirmed a CTG repeat expansion in the DMPK gene, consistent with DM1.",
