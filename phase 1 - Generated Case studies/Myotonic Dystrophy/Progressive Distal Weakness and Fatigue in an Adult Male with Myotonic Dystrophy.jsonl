    "title": "Progressive Distal Weakness and Fatigue in an Adult Male with Myotonic Dystrophy",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Samuel Wright is a 38-year-old accountant who presents with progressive weakness and myotonia, most prominent over the past two years. He reports difficulty releasing his grip after shaking hands or using tools (eg, screwdriver), and notes increasing clumsiness and trouble climbing stairs due to 'heavy legs.' Facial muscle weakness has contributed to ptosis and difficulty with articulation. He has experienced increased fatigue throughout the day and muscle pain, particularly in his distal extremities. His wife reports that he snores loudly and occasionally stops breathing at night. Mr. Wright has a history of early-onset cataracts (removed at 34) and mild type 2 diabetes diagnosed last year. There is a significant family history, with his mother developing similar symptoms in her 40s. He denies any traumatic injuries.",

    "easing_factors": "Brief rest periods and gentle stretching; warm environments tend to reduce myotonia.",

    "medical_history": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus diagnosed one year ago (mild, diet-controlled initially). No known cardiac events, but family history significant for cardiac arrhythmia in mother.",
    "medications": "Metformin 500mg daily, multivitamin. No regular pain medication.",
    "personal_history": "Married, two children (ages 8 and 5). Non-smoker, consumes alcohol occasionally. Sedentary occupation; low physical activity outside of work. Reports feelings of frustration and mild depression due to progressive disability and reduced social engagement.",
    "imaging": "NCS/EMG: Myotonia and distal muscle weakness; muscle biopsy and genetic testing confirmed diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy type 1.",
