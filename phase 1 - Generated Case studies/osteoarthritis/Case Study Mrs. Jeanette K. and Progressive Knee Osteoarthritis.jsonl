    "title": "Case Study: Mrs. Jeanette K. and Progressive Knee Osteoarthritis",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Jeanette K. is a 67-year-old retired librarian who presents with a gradual onset of right knee pain over the past 6 years, progressively worsening in the last 12 months. She reports stiffness in the morning lasting about 20 minutes, which eases with gentle movement. The pain is aggravated by walking long distances (more than one block), descending stairs, and rising from a low chair. She also experiences increased discomfort after periods of gardening or shopping. She notices crepitus with knee movement and mild swelling after heavy use, with no locking but occasional feelings of instability. She denies nocturnal pain unless she had an active day. There is no history of trauma, but she reports a history of being overweight (BMI 32) and a previous diagnosis of prediabetes.",
