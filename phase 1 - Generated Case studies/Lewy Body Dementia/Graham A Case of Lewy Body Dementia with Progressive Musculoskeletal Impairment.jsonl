    "title": "Graham: A Case of Lewy Body Dementia with Progressive Musculoskeletal Impairment",
    "clinical_history": "Graham is a 70-year-old retired engineer who presented with a two-year history of progressive cognitive decline, vivid visual hallucinations, fluctuating levels of attention, and recent onset of parkinsonian motor features. He reports frequent episodes of muscle stiffness, particularly in the lower limbs and axial muscles, described as a persistent ache with intermittent cramping. He mentions difficulty rising from chairs, shuffling gait, and two recent falls in the past month. His sleep is disturbed due to acting out dreams (REM sleep behavior disorder), and his wife notes increased slowness in movement and occasional tremulousness. Graham finds activities of daily living increasingly challenging, needing assistance with dressing and bathing. He also reports dull pain in his lumbar region, possibly due to his increasingly stooped posture.",

    "easing_factors": "Resting in a reclined position, gentle stretching, application of moist heat, and slow, assisted mobilization.",
    "past_history": "No significant orthopaedic injuries relevant to complaint. History of hypertension (well-managed) and mild osteoarthritis of the knees.",
    "medical_history": "Diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia 18 months ago. No history of cerebrovascular accidents or significant trauma.",
    "medications": "Currently on rivastigmine patch (for cognitive symptoms), low-dose levodopa/carbidopa (for motor symptoms), and melatonin at bedtime for REM sleep disorder; paracetamol as needed for pain.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with his wife who is his primary carer; two adult children living independently. Formerly very active, Graham has withdrawn from most social and recreational activities due to fear of hallucinations and falls.",
    "imaging": "Recent brain MRI showing mild generalized atrophy, greater in occipital and parietal regions; no acute infarct or mass lesion.",
