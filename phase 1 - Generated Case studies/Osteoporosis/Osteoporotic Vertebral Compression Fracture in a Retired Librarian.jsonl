    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Patricia Liu, a 68-year-old retired librarian, presents with a 1-week history of sudden mid-thoracic back pain following bending over to retrieve a book from a low shelf at home. She describes the pain as sharp and localized over the mid-back, with no significant radiation. She notes increased pain during activities involving trunk flexion or prolonged standing, and reports difficulty sleeping due to pain when turning in bed. She does not recall any major trauma. Patricia denies any preceding fever, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats. She has noticed gradual loss of height and increased thoracic kyphosis over the previous two years.",
