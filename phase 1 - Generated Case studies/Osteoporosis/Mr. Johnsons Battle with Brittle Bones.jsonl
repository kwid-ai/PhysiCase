    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Battle with Brittle Bones",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Richard Johnson, 72, is a retired carpenter who arrived at the clinic following a low-impact fall in his garden. He reports widespread bone pain, especially in the lumbar spine and hips, making daily activities challenging. A recent DXA scan confirmed he has osteoporosis. He recalls having lost 1.5 inches in height over the past few years and has a history of backaches that he attributed to 'old age' and his prior occupation. There is also a newly present kyphosis, giving him a slightly hunched back, more noticeable in the past year.",
