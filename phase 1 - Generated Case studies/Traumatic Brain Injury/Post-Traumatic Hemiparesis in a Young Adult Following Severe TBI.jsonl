    "title": "Post-Traumatic Hemiparesis in a Young Adult Following Severe TBI",
    "clinical_history": "Jonathan is a 27-year-old male who suffered a severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) six months ago as a result of a high-speed motor vehicle accident. He was an unrestrained passenger. He was initially comatose for two weeks and required a prolonged ICU admission with neurosurgical intervention for an acute subdural hematoma (right frontoparietal craniotomy). He is currently attending outpatient neurorehabilitation with ongoing left-sided hemiparesis and increased tone (spasticity), affecting, in particular, his left upper and lower limb. He complains of persistent muscle tightness in his left arm (biceps, wrist flexors) and left leg (quadriceps, hamstrings, and calf muscles). He also reports diffuse, aching left shoulder pain (likely subluxation and secondary immobility) and lesser intermittent headaches. Jonathan has moderate difficulty in ADLs and ambulates short distances with a cane, with significant foot drop and circumduction on the left.",
