Emma reports increased fatigue, joint pain, and a characteristic butterfly rash on her face, mainly exacerbated over the past 3/52 due to increased workload and stress. Emma first noted symptoms such as mild joint pain and occasional fevers, which over time progressed to include severe fatigue, noticeable hair loss, and a photosensitive rash. Currently, she struggles most with pain and stiffness in her hands (P1) and knees (P2), exacerbated by her sedentary work environment and long hours at the computer.",
