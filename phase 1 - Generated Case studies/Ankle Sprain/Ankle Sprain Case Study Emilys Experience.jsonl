    "clinical_history": "Emily, a 28-year-old recreational soccer player, presented to the clinic with a complaint of severe pain and swelling on the lateral aspect of her right ankle. She reported that during a soccer game 2 days ago, she landed awkwardly on her right ankle while trying to change direction quickly, which resulted in a sudden sharp pain and a feeling of 'giving way'. She was unable to bear weight on her ankle immediately after the injury and had to be helped off the field. Since then, she has been experiencing pain, swelling, and stiffness in her ankle, making it difficult for her to walk or participate in daily activities.",
