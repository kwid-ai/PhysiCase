    "clinical_history": "Mr. Ramesh Bhatia is a 48-year-old bank manager who presents with a three-month history of gradually worsening double vision, drooping of both eyelids (worse in the evenings), and increasing difficulty with chewing and swallowing solid foods by the end of the workday. He notes voice fatigue during long conversations and increased weakness, especially after exertion or late in the day. In the mornings, he feels relatively well, but as the day progresses, he frequently experiences weakness in his facial musculature, difficulty raising his arms to comb his hair, and muscle fatigue without sensory disturbances. His symptoms improve with short rest and after meals. He denies any respiratory difficulties but feels subjectively weaker over the recent few weeks.",
