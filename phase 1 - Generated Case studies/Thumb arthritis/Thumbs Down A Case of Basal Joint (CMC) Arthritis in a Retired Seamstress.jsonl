    "title": "Thumbs Down: A Case of Basal Joint (CMC) Arthritis in a Retired Seamstress",
    "clinical_history": "Margaret is a 67-year-old retired seamstress who presents with progressive right thumb base pain over the past 8 months. She first noticed discomfort when turning keys and opening jars, which she initially attributed to 'overuse.' The pain gradually worsened, now elicited during daily activities such as gripping scissors, pinching buttons, and holding a cup. She reports intermittent swelling at the thumb base and occasional grinding sensations. Functional tasks, like buttoning shirts or opening door knobs, have become increasingly difficult. Morning stiffness lasts 10–15 minutes but resolves with hand movement. On examination, there is visible swelling at the first carpometacarpal joint, tenderness along the thumb base, reduced pinch strength, and a positive grind test. She denies any recent trauma.",

    "imaging": "Hand X-rays reveal joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation at the right thumb CMC joint, consistent with moderate osteoarthritis.",
