    "title": "Chronic Cervicogenic Headache in an Office Worker",
    "clinical_history": "David is a 42-year-old marketing executive who presents with a 5-month history of persistent headaches, primarily felt at the back of the head and upper neck, sometimes radiating to the temples and behind the eyes. The pain is described as a dull, aching pressure with intermittent sharp exacerbations. He reports that the headaches typically intensify after prolonged computer work and are often worse towards the end of the workday. David notes associated neck stiffness and occasional mild dizziness, but denies visual changes, nausea, or photophobia. He does not recall any recent trauma but admits to poor posture at his desk and increasing work-related stress. Over-the-counter analgesics provide only temporary relief.",
