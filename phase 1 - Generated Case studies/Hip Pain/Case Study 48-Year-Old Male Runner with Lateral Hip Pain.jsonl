    "condition": "Hip Pain",
    "title": "Case Study: 48-Year-Old Male Runner with Lateral Hip Pain",
    "clinical_history": "The patient, Mr. Roberts, is a 48-year-old financial analyst who presents with a chief complaint of progressively worsening right-sided hip pain over the last six weeks. The onset was insidious, with no specific trauma or incident. Mr. Roberts recently started training for his first 10k race three months ago, and he admits to rapidly increasing his mileage and intensity without proper guidance. Initially, he noted a dull ache over the outside of his hip only after running. However, the pain has now progressed to a constant ache with intermittent sharp, shooting pains during specific movements. It has significantly impacted his training, forcing him to cease running entirely for the past ten days. He reports a sensation of weakness when pushing off the right leg. He denies any numbness, tingling, or catching sensations in the hip joint.",

    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Lying on the right side at night, ascending or descending stairs (right leg as the stance limb), running (especially on uneven surfaces or inclines), prolonged sitting for more than 45 minutes, and transitioning from sit-to-stand.",
    "picture": "The patient reports significant morning stiffness and pain for the first 30 minutes, which gradually eases with gentle movement. During his workday (which is largely sedentary), the pain returns as a dull ache. The symptoms are most pronounced in the evening and at night, frequently disturbing his sleep, especially when he inadvertently rolls onto the affected side.",
    "easing_factors": "Complete rest from running, application of ice packs to the lateral hip for 15 minutes, sleeping on his back or left side with a pillow positioned between his knees, and taking NSAIDs.",
    "past_history": "The patient has no significant past musculoskeletal injuries. He does report occasional episodes of mild, self-resolving lower back ache which he attributes to his sedentary job, but it has never required formal medical intervention.",
    "medical_history": "Diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia five years ago, which is well-managed with medication. He is otherwise in good health. He is a non-smoker and reports consuming one to two glasses of wine per week.",
    "medications": "Atorvastatin 20mg daily. He has been taking Naproxen 220mg twice daily as needed for the hip pain over the last two weeks.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Roberts works in a high-stress environment, spending 8-9 hours per day sitting at a desk. He is married with two teenage children and lives in a two-story house. He is highly motivated to complete his 10k race and expresses significant frustration and concern over this physical setback.",
    "imaging": "His primary care physician ordered plain film radiographs (X-rays) of the right hip and pelvis two weeks ago. The report indicated 'no signs of fracture, avascular necrosis, or significant osteoarthritic changes'.",
