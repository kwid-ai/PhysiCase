    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Right Hip Pain in a Recreational Runner – Possible Greater Trochanteric Pain Syndrome",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Thomas Ackers is a 47-year-old recreational runner who presents with a 3-month history of gradually worsening right lateral hip pain. The pain began insidiously after he increased his weekly running distance from 10km to 20km, preparing for a half marathon. He describes the pain as an aching and sometimes burning sensation, primarily located over the lateral aspect of the right hip, occasionally radiating down the lateral thigh. The pain worsens during prolonged walking, running, or when climbing stairs. He also experiences pain when lying on his right side at night, which occasionally wakes him. He denies any recent trauma, numbness, or systemic symptoms. He reports minor morning stiffness that resolves within 15 minutes and increased soreness after long periods of inactivity.",
