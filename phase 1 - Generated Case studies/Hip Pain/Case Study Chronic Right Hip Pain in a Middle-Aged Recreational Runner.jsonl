    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Right Hip Pain in a Middle-Aged Recreational Runner",
    "clinical_history": "James T., a 48-year-old accountant and recreational long-distance runner, presents with a 6-month history of right-sided hip pain. The pain started gradually after increasing his running mileage in preparation for a half-marathon. Initially, discomfort was felt as a dull ache deep in the lateral aspect of the right hip, particularly after runs longer than 10 km, but has since become more pronounced and persistent. He reports sharp pain during the first steps after sitting for extended periods, going up stairs, and during the stance phase of running. Resting or reducing activity offers mild relief, but pain often returns when activity is resumed. James also notes episodes of night pain when turning in bed and occasional stiffness in the morning that resolves after about 15–20 minutes. No significant trauma or acute injury was recalled at onset. He describes having less confidence on the right leg, particularly during uneven terrain running, but denies any falls or giving way. No significant swelling noted, but intermittent clicking and mild restriction in internal rotation of the hip are present on movement.",
