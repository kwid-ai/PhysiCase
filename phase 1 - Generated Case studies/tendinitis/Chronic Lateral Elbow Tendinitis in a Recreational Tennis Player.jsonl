    "title": "Chronic Lateral Elbow Tendinitis in a Recreational Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John McClellan is a 44-year-old right-handed accountant who presents with a 3-month history of persistent lateral right elbow pain. The onset was insidious but correlates with his return to weekend tennis after a 12-year hiatus. He reports playing two to three times per week, 1-2 hours per session. He first noted mild discomfort during backhand swings, which progressed to an aching pain that persists at rest and worsens with gripping activities such as shaking hands, opening jars, or holding his coffee mug. He denies any trauma, swelling, numbness, or systemic symptoms. He has been self-managing with occasional ice and over-the-counter analgesics, with negligible improvement.",
