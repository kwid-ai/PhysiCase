    "title": "James: Managing Lower Limb Weakness and Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 38-year-old male software engineer presenting with a 6-month history of intermittent bilateral lower limb weakness, numbness, and increasing difficulty with balance. He first noticed symptoms after a viral illness, reporting an unsteady gait and heaviness in both legs, particularly after prolonged periods of activity. Over the past two months, he has developed spasticity in the right quadriceps and hamstrings, and occasional burning dysesthesia in his feet. There are no signs of acute relapse, but the fatigue and muscular tightness have gradually worsened, especially by the end of the workday. He currently ambulates independently but has experienced two minor falls in the last month. He receives outpatient neurology follow-up and is under disease-modifying treatment.",
