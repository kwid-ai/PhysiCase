    "title": "Mr. Roberts: A Case of Age-Related Sarcopenia and Functional Decline",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Samuel Roberts is a 74-year-old retired postal worker referred by his primary care physician due to progressive weakness, decreased muscle mass, and difficulty performing activities of daily living over the past 18 months. Mr. Roberts reports increasing reliance on his cane and furniture for support when rising from chairs or getting out of bed. He describes generalized fatigue, noticeable thinning of his upper and lower limb muscles, and two minor falls in the past six months while getting up from low chairs. He denies acute pain but reports a sense of heaviness and occasional aching in his thighs, especially after long walks or household tasks. His wife also notes he walks slower, struggles to climb stairs, and hesitates before stepping off curbs. He remains cognitively intact and denies any confusion.",
