    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel Li is a 48-year-old accountant who contracted Coronavirus (COVID-19) seven weeks ago. He experienced moderate respiratory symptoms, including cough, shortness of breath, and fever, requiring 5 days of hospital admission but no intensive care. Two weeks following acute illness, he developed persistent, diffuse muscle aches and profound fatigue. He complains of deep aching pain primarily in his thighs and shoulder girdle, with milder discomfort in the lumbar region. He reports difficulty climbing stairs, standing from a seated position, and lifting moderate weights due to both pain and subjective weakness. He experiences heightened symptoms following minimal exertion, necessitating rest periods throughout the workday. He describes his pain as constant but fluctuating, with notable exacerbation in the evening.",
