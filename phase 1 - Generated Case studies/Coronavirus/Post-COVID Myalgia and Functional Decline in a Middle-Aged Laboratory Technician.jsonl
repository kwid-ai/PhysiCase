    "clinical_history": "Mr. Raj Kapoor is a 48-year-old laboratory technician who presented to physiotherapy following a confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 four weeks ago. His acute infection was moderate: he required hospitalization for supplemental oxygen (via nasal cannula) for 8 days but was not admitted to ICU. He reports persistent generalized muscle aches and marked weakness, particularly in the lower limbs—thighs and calves—as well as diffuse shoulder girdle discomfort. He denies prior similar complaints and previously enjoyed walking 5 km most mornings. At follow-up, Raj describes difficulty rising from a chair, climbing stairs, and persistent fatigue that limits his activity. He also reports disrupted sleep due to muscle discomfort. He denies chest pain or shortness of breath, though notes occasional dry cough. No neurological deficits are evident, but his muscle bulk appears slightly reduced. He does not report joint swelling or redness.",
