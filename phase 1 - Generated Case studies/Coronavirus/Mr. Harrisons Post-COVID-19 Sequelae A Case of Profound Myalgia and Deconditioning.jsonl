    "title": "Mr. Harrison's Post-COVID-19 Sequelae: A Case of Profound Myalgia and Deconditioning",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Harrison is a 58-year-old male, a former construction manager, who presents to our outpatient clinic with a referral for 'generalized weakness post-COVID-19 infection.' He contracted a severe case of SARS-CoV-2 approximately 10 weeks ago, which necessitated a 12-day hospital admission, including a 4-day stay in the ICU on high-flow supplemental oxygen (non-intubated). Since his discharge 8 weeks ago, he reports debilitating fatigue and widespread muscle soreness that has significantly curtailed his functional capacity. He struggles with basic ADLs, such as showering and dressing, which he reports as being 'exhausting.' His primary goal is to 'get his strength back' so he can return to his hobbies of woodworking and fishing.",

            "context": "P1",
            "affected_area": "Generalized, deep, aching pain in major muscle groups, primarily bilateral quadriceps, gluteals, and lumbar paraspinals. He describes it not as a sharp pain, but a 'profound whole-body ache,' similar to the worst flu he's ever had.",
            "score": "3-4/10 at rest, increasing to 7-8/10 with minimal exertion"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Any form of sustained physical activity. Specifically, walking for more than 5 minutes, ascending a flight of stairs (which he must do one step at a time), standing for more than 10-15 minutes, and lifting anything heavier than a gallon of milk. He notes a significant increase in fatigue and pain the day *after* attempting any activity, a phenomenon known as post-exertional malaise.",
    "picture": "[Image of a human figure with diffuse shading over the thighs, buttocks, and low back to indicate generalized myalgia, as well as the chest to represent respiratory muscle fatigue.]",
    "easing_factors": "Complete rest and strategic pacing of activities throughout the day. He has learned to break down tasks into smaller, manageable chunks with prolonged rest periods in between. Short periods of sitting or reclining are essential after any activity.",
    "past_history": "Left rotator cuff repair 5 years ago with excellent recovery. Otherwise, he reports no significant musculoskeletal history and was physically active and robust prior to his illness.",
    "medical_history": "Hypertension (HTN), well-controlled for 10 years. Pre-diabetic. Hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia 10 weeks prior. Chest X-ray upon discharge showed resolving bilateral ground-glass opacities consistent with his diagnosis.",
    "medications": "Lisinopril 10mg daily for HTN. He was also prescribed a course of Dexamethasone during his hospital stay, which has since been completed.",
    "personal_history": "Retired for the last 3 years. Lives with his wife in a two-story home. He is an avid outdoorsman but has been unable to engage in any of his hobbies since his illness. He expresses significant frustration and a low mood related to his current physical limitations and dependency on his wife for household chores he previously managed.",
    "imaging": "Chest X-ray from hospital discharge 8 weeks ago noted. No musculoskeletal imaging has been performed for his current complaints, as the presentation is consistent with post-viral syndrome rather than a focal structural pathology.",
