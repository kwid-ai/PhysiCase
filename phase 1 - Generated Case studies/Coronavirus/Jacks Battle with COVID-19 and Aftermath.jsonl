    "clinical_history": "Jack is a 42-year-old IT consultant who developed symptoms of COVID-19 two months ago. His initial symptoms included fever, cough, and a general feeling of unwellness. Four days later, he experienced difficulty breathing and was admitted to the hospital where he tested positive for the coronavirus. After a week in the hospital, including three days in the ICU, Jack's condition stabilized and he was discharged to quarantine at home. Despite recovery from the acute phase of the illness, he continues to experience lingering symptoms, including fatigue and shortness of breath upon exertion. Jack expresses concerns regarding muscle weakness, particularly in his thighs, and complains of joint pain in his knees and elbows. These symptoms are adversely impacting his ability to return to work and partake in everyday activities.",
