    "title": "Case Study: Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy in an Adolescent Male",
    "clinical_history": "Jacob is a 15-year-old adolescent male with a diagnosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy since infancy, attributed to premature birth at 29 weeks and prolonged neonatal intensive care unit stay. Jacob is ambulatory with the aid of bilateral forearm crutches but has a markedly crouched gait. His primary complaints are increased tightness and pain in his lower limbs, particularly after attending school or participating in adapted physical education. His parents note recent worsening of toe-walking and difficulty with transfers. He requires assistance with activities of daily living involving stairs and reports frequent muscle spasms, which sometimes disrupt his sleep. Jacob attends regular physiotherapy and uses orthoses for mobility support.",
