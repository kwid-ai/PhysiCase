    "title": "Acute Exertional Rhabdomyolysis in a Novice Weightlifter",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 28-year-old male who recently decided to start a high-intensity weightlifting program after years of a sedentary lifestyle. Last weekend, he participated in a strenuous gym session under the supervision of a friend, performing multiple sets of squats, deadlifts, and lunges targeting the lower limbs, with insufficient rest between sets. Within 24 hours, Mark developed severe muscle pain, profound weakness in both thighs, and noticed dark-colored urine. He reported increasing swelling and tenderness of his thighs, making ambulation and stair climbing very difficult. On examination, he has marked tenderness and edema of bilateral quadriceps, with localized warmth but no erythema.",
