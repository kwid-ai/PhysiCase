    "title": "Case Study: Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy in an Adolescent Male",
    "clinical_history": "James, a 14-year-old male, presents to the outpatient physical therapy clinic accompanied by his mother. He was diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy shortly after birth due to premature delivery at 29 weeks. James has a history of delayed motor milestones and underwent bilateral Achilles tendon lengthening at age 7. He ambulates independently but with marked scissoring gait, increased effort, and frequent tripping. He reports persistent tightness in both hamstrings and calves, worsening throughout the day, especially after prolonged walking or during physical education classes. Occasionally, James complains of cramping discomfort in his lower legs, particularly in the evenings. There are no new neurological symptoms. Spasticity predominantly affects his lower limbs with mild adductor involvement. He uses a single-point cane intermittently when fatigued.",

    "medical_history": "No seizures or significant comorbidities. Vaccination history up to date. Growth parameters within normal percentile for age.",
    "medications": "Baclofen 10 mg PO bid for lower limb spasticity; uses salbutamol inhaler prn for occasional asthma symptoms.",
    "personal_history": "Resides with both parents and two siblings. Attends mainstream school with physical adaptations. Enjoys video games and chess; limited participation in sports due to motor limitations. Family is supportive, with mother as primary caregiver.",
    "imaging": "Recent pelvic x-ray shows mild bilateral hip subluxation (<20%). No bony deformities requiring intervention at present. Previous MRI at age 6 revealed periventricular leukomalacia consistent with prematurity.",
