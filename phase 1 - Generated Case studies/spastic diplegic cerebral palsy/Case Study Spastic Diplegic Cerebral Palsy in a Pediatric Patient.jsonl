    "title": "Case Study: Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy in a Pediatric Patient",
    "clinical_history": "Jacob is an 8-year-old male referred to the clinic by his pediatrician for assessment and ongoing management of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. He was born prematurely at 31 weeks gestation via C-section due to maternal pre-eclampsia. Initial NICU stay of 5 weeks; neonatal course complicated by mild intraventricular hemorrhage. Parents report delayed motor milestones: sitting unsupported at 15 months, walking at 3 years with a walker. Currently ambulates short distances indoors with a posterior walker, exhibiting pronounced bilateral lower limb spasticity, scissoring gait, and toe-walking. Recurrent falls (1–2 times per week) are noted, typically during transitions or while fatigued. Jacob attends mainstream school with individualized support. He experiences muscular tightness and pain, notably in the hamstrings and gastrocnemius, especially during physical activity and rapid growth spurts, impacting participation in PE and outdoor play.",

    "medications": "Oral baclofen 5 mg BID to reduce spasticity, salbutamol inhaler PRN for asthma.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with both parents and one younger sibling in an urban apartment. Attends grade 3 in a mainstream elementary school with a shadow aide. Enjoys drawing and building with Legos; avoids most physical games due to fatigue and frequent falls.",
    "imaging": "Brain MRI at age 2 showed periventricular leukomalacia consistent with premature birth; no further imaging conducted to date.",
