    "title": "Benjamin's Battle with Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "Benjamin is a 12-year-old boy diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at the age of 2. He was born prematurely at 29 weeks and required ventilation due to respiratory distress syndrome. He reached his developmental milestones later than expected, achieving head control at 6 months adjusted age, rolling at 12 months, and independent sitting by 18 months. Benjamin started walking independently at 3 years of age but with noticeable toe walking, particularly on the right side. He has ongoing struggles with balance and coordination and often uses a walker for outdoor ambulation.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Long distances, uneven terrain, fatigue, increased physical demand such as participating in sports or dance.",
    "picture": "[insert image highlighting bilateral lower extremities with focus on calf, hamstring and hip]",
    "easing_factors": "Rest, stretching exercises, warm water therapy, and use of assistive devices like a walker.",
    "past_history": "Benjamin underwent serial casting at 4 years old to manage foot alignment and underwent a selective dorsal rhizotomy at 7 years old to decrease spasticity and improve mobility. Post-rhizotomy, he showed improved range of motion and function.",
    "medical_history": "Aside from his cerebral palsy, Benjamin is overall healthy. He has seasonal allergies and is on antihistamine therapy as needed.",
    "medications": "Occasional use of Baclofen to reduce muscle stiffness, and Botulinum toxin injections have been administered in the past for targeted muscle groups.",
    "personal_history": "Benjamin is a cheerful and motivated young boy. He attends a mainstream school with the assistance of a classroom aide. He is exceptionally gifted in mathematics and enjoys video games. His family is actively involved in his therapy, and he has a supportive network of friends.",
    "imaging": "MRI performed at age 2 revealed periventricular leukomalacia, consistent with a history of prematurity and cerebral palsy.",
