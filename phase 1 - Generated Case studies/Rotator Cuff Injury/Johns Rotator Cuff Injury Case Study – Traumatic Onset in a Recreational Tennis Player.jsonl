    "clinical_history": "John is a 48-year-old right-handed accountant who presents with a 3-week history of right shoulder pain following a forceful overhead smash while playing tennis. He describes a sudden 'tearing' sensation during the incident, accompanied by immediate pain and difficulty raising his arm. Since then, he experiences persistent ache over the lateral upper arm and struggles with overhead activities, dressing, and sleeping on his right side. His pain is aggravated by reaching, lifting objects, or performing activities above shoulder level. There is noticeable weakness in abduction and rotation. He denies any neck pain, previous shoulder surgery, or recent systemic illness.",
