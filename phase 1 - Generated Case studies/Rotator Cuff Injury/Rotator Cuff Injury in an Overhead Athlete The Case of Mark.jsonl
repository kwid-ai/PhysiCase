    "title": "Rotator Cuff Injury in an Overhead Athlete: The Case of Mark",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 38-year-old recreational tennis player and sales executive who presents with a 3-week history of progressive right shoulder pain. The onset was insidious, initially noticed during an overhead smash in a competitive match. He describes the pain as deep and poorly localized over the lateral aspect of the shoulder, exacerbated by serving, lifting objects overhead, and reaching behind his back. There is night pain, particularly when lying on the right shoulder, resulting in disrupted sleep. He reports weakness in the arm, especially during abduction and external rotation. He denies any significant trauma, numbness, or tingling. He has reduced ability to carry briefcases and perform work-related presentations that require overhead pointing.",
