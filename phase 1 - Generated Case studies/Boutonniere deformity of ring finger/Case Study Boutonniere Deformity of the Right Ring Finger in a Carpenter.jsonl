    "title": "Case Study: Boutonniere Deformity of the Right Ring Finger in a Carpenter",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Simon Hartwell is a 47-year-old carpenter presenting with a progressive flexion deformity of his right ring finger over the past 3 weeks following a laceration injury at work. He reports having sustained a deep cut across the dorsal aspect of the PIP joint while handling a chisel. Initially, there was mild swelling and pain with movement. Over the last 10 days, he has noticed increasing difficulty in straightening the middle joint of his ring finger while the fingertip seems to hyperextend. He complains of pain and tenderness primarily over the dorsal PIP joint, worsened with any attempt at finger extension. He is unable to fully extend the affected finger, and this has significantly affected his ability to grip and manipulate tools, impacting his work productivity.",
