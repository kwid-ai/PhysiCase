    "condition": "Boutonniere deformity of ring finger",
    "title": "Case Presentation: Chronic Post-Traumatic Boutonniere Deformity in a Collegiate Athlete",
    "clinical_history": "The patient, Michael, is a 21-year-old, right-hand dominant male collegiate basketball player who presents with a chief complaint of a 'crooked' and painful left ring finger. The injury occurred approximately 6 weeks ago during a basketball practice. He reports sustaining a forceful axial load to the tip of his extended left ring finger when trying to catch a pass, causing a sudden and painful forced flexion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint. He initially dismissed it as a 'jammed finger,' applying ice intermittently and continuing to play. Over the subsequent 2-3 weeks, he noticed a progressive inability to straighten the middle joint of the finger, coupled with a hyperextension of the end joint. The finger now presents with a classic deformity which significantly impacts his ball-handling skills and daily activities. He notes pain and a feeling of weakness when trying to grip or extend the digit.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Attempting to fully straighten the finger, gripping a basketball or water bottle, typing, buttoning a shirt, and any direct impact or pressure over the dorsal PIP joint.",
    "picture": "[Schematic drawing of a hand showing flexion at the PIP joint and hyperextension at the DIP joint of the ring finger, with the central slip of the extensor tendon highlighted as the site of injury.]",
    "easing_factors": "Resting the hand, avoiding gripping tasks, and passively holding the finger in an extended position.",
    "past_history": "History of minor finger sprains to both hands secondary to basketball, all of which resolved without medical intervention and with no residual deficits. No previous hand fractures or surgeries.",
    "medical_history": "The central slip of the extensor digitorum communis tendon at its insertion on the base of the middle phalanx of the ring finger has been attenuated or ruptured. This leads to volar subluxation of the lateral bands of the extensor mechanism. These displaced lateral bands then act as flexors at the PIP joint and extensors at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, creating the characteristic deformity. The triangular ligament, which normally prevents this volar displacement, is also likely damaged.",
    "medications": "Ibuprofen 400mg, as needed (prn) for pain, approximately 3-4 times per week.",
    "personal_history": "Michael is a full-time university student majoring in business and a starting player on the university's basketball team. His scholarship is dependent on his athletic participation. He is concerned about his ability to return to his previous level of performance and the long-term function of his hand.",
    "imaging": "X-rays of the left hand were performed 1 week ago to rule out an avulsion fracture of the middle phalanx. Results were negative for any acute fracture or dislocation.",
