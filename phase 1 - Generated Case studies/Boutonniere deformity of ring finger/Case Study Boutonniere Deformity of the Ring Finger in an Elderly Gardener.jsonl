    "title": "Case Study: Boutonniere Deformity of the Ring Finger in an Elderly Gardener",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Walter Hughes is a 68-year-old retired school principal and avid gardener who presents with a 3-week history of deformity and swelling of his right ring finger following a minor laceration sustained while pruning rose bushes. He initially managed the wound at home. Within days, Walter noticed increasing swelling and difficulty extending the middle joint (PIP) of his finger while the tip (DIP) became hyperextended. He reports pain and stiffness, especially when grasping tools or making a fist. On examination, there is evident flexion at the PIP and hyperextension at the DIP of the right ring finger, with tenderness and swelling localized to the PIP region. He denies numbness or tingling in the hand. Functionally, he struggles to grip objects, limiting his gardening activities significantly.",

    "easing_factors": "Resting the hand, gentle passive extension exercises, warm water soaks, topical NSAID gel applications.",
    "past_history": "No previous hand trauma. He reports well-controlled Type II diabetes for 15 years, which occasionally delays wound healing.",
    "medical_history": "Type II diabetes mellitus (diagnosed 15 years ago), hypertension; both managed with medications. No known allergies.",
    "medications": "Metformin 1000mg BID, Lisinopril 10mg daily, topical Diclofenac gel for finger pain as needed.",
    "personal_history": "Married, non-smoker, rarely consumes alcohol, lives an active lifestyle primarily through gardening and daily walks. Retired, previously a school administrator. Enjoys wood carvingâ€”temporarily ceased due to finger deformity.",
    "imaging": "Plain radiograph of right hand rules out fracture; no evidence of bone involvement, confirms soft tissue injury at the PIP. No subluxation of the PIP joint.",
