    "title": "Boutonniere Deformity of the Ring Finger in a 45-Year-Old Pianist",
    "clinical_history": "A 45-year-old right-handed pianist presents with a 6-week history of progressive deformity and pain in the ring finger of her right hand.  She first noticed the problem after a concert where she played for an extended period.  Initially, she experienced stiffness and mild pain in the finger, which she attributed to overuse.  However, over the following weeks, the finger began to buckle at the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint and hyperextend at the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, resulting in a Boutonniere deformity.  She reports difficulty playing the piano and performing daily activities such as dressing and grooming.",
