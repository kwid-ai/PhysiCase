    "title": "Case Study: Mr. Jeffrey Adams – Chronic Hip Osteoarthritis Impacting Daily Mobility",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Jeffrey Adams is a 67-year-old retired postal worker presenting to the outpatient physical therapy clinic complaining of persistent right hip pain ongoing for the past 9 months, with gradual onset. Initially, he noticed an intermittent, dull ache deep in his right groin region, especially after walking for extended periods or rising from a seated position. Over the past four months, the pain intensity and frequency have increased, now affecting his ability to walk more than 20 minutes and causing a pronounced limp by the end of the day. He experiences marked morning stiffness lasting over 45 minutes and difficulty ascending stairs. He reports secondary discomfort along the lateral aspect of his hip, occasionally radiating into the upper thigh. He denies any history of significant trauma but reports previous minor right hip ‘aches’ after long walks over the last 6-7 years. Clicking and catching sensations are present, but no locking. Sleep is increasingly disturbed due to discomfort when rolling or lying on his right side.",

    "past_history": "History of mild right hip discomfort following extensive walking or hiking over past several years, but was manageable without medical intervention until this past year. Mild right ankle sprain 12 years previously; full recovery.",

    "medications": "Lisinopril 20mg daily, Atorvastatin 10mg daily, Acetaminophen 500mg as needed (up to 2x/day recently for pain)",
