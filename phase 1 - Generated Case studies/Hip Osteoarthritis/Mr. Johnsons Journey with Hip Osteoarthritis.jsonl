    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Journey with Hip Osteoarthritis",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. James Johnson is a 67-year-old retired carpenter. He initially started experiencing discomfort in his right hip approximately 3 years ago. Gradually, this discomfort has evolved into a persistent, deep, aching pain localized mainly around the right groin and extending to the anterior thigh. His pain level exacerbates with certain movements like standing for more than 10-15 minutes or during prolonged walks. Occasionally, Mr. Johnson feels a grinding sensation in his hip joint. The pain is worse in the morning and tends to ease off slightly after some movement but then increases again as the day progresses.",
