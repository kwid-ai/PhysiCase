    "title": "Case Study: Rehabilitation Challenges in a Transfemoral Amputee – Mr. John Proctor",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Proctor is a 48-year-old male, formerly employed as a construction site foreman, who underwent a left transfemoral (above-knee) amputation 7 months ago following a severe workplace accident involving a heavy machinery crush injury. Since the amputation, Mr. Proctor reports persistent pain and decreased mobility, despite the use of a custom-fitted prosthesis. His primary complaint is distal thigh stump pain (P1), ranging from deep aching to occasional sharp, burning sensations, particularly after periods of prosthetic use or prolonged ambulation. He also describes secondary low back pain (P2), which he attributes to altered gait mechanics and prolonged use of crutches prior to receiving his prosthesis. Mr. Proctor is motivated to regain independence but has noted increasing frustration with residual limb discomfort, phantom limb sensations, and difficulty sleeping.",

    "easing_factors": "Rest (removing prosthesis when possible), use of residual limb shrinker, warm compresses, gentle stump massage, and short periods of non-weight-bearing activity. Occasional use of acetaminophen provides moderate relief.",
    "past_history": "No significant medical or surgical history prior to the accident. No prior history of musculoskeletal pain or injury.",
    "medical_history": "Unremarkable prior to the incident. Recent psychological stress related to adjustment and adaptation post-amputation.",
    "medications": "Acetaminophen 500 mg as needed for pain. Sertraline 50 mg once daily for symptoms of mild depression.",
    "personal_history": "Divorced, lives alone in a single-level apartment. Prior to injury, was physically active and enjoyed hiking and carpentry. Reports emotional struggles with loss of limb and identity as a worker. Support is limited to periodic visits from adult children and a local friend. Currently undergoing counseling for emotional adaptation.",
    "imaging": "Post-operative radiographs confirm well-healed distal femoral stump with no signs of osteomyelitis or heterotopic ossification.",
