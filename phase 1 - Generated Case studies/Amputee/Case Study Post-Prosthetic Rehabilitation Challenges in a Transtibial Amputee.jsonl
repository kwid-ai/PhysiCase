    "title": "Case Study: Post-Prosthetic Rehabilitation Challenges in a Transtibial Amputee",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Jonathan Miller is a 62-year-old retired construction worker who is 4 months post-right transtibial amputation. The amputation was necessary due to a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer which progressed to gangrene, a complication of his long-standing Type 2 Diabetes and associated Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD). He was fitted with his first patellar tendon-bearing (PTB) prosthesis 6 weeks ago and was referred to outpatient physical therapy for gait training and functional mobility. Despite his motivation, progress has been significantly stalled. Mr. Miller reports two distinct types of pain: a distressing phantom limb pain (P1) and a problematic residual limb pain (P2). He is also developing compensatory low back pain (P3). He finds he can only tolerate wearing his prosthesis for short periods (< 30 minutes) before the pain becomes unbearable, which has led to significant frustration and a growing fear of falling. His primary goal is to walk independently in his community and return to his hobby of gardening.",

    "picture": "In the morning, Mr. Miller reports his residual limb is at its smallest volume, making the prosthesis feel slightly loose. He experiences significant morning stiffness in his contralateral (left) hip and lower back. As the day progresses with intermittent activity, the residual limb swells, causing the prosthetic socket to become tight and painful, aggravating P2. P1 and P3 worsen with fatigue towards the end of the day. He often has difficulty sleeping due to phantom limb pain, which can be triggered by the touch of bedsheets.",
    "easing_factors": "Doffing (removing) the prosthesis. Elevating the residual limb. Gentle massage and tapping on the residual limb. Mirror therapy (has been instructed but compliance is inconsistent). Distraction techniques (e.g., watching television, listening to music). Gabapentin for P1.",
    "past_history": "15-year history of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, with suboptimal glycemic control over the last 5 years. Diagnosed with PVD 3 years ago after reporting intermittent claudication. He is a former smoker (quit 10 years ago, 20-pack-year history). Prior to the ulcer, he was independent with all mobility and enjoyed an active retirement.",
    "medical_history": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD), Hypertension (HTN), Hyperlipidemia. Right Transtibial Amputation 4 months ago. Otherwise, no other major surgeries or medical issues.",

    "personal_history": "Retired construction worker. Lives with his wife of 40 years in a single-story home with three steps to enter. His wife is his primary caregiver and is very supportive, though anxious about his recovery. Mr. Miller expresses feelings of deep frustration and low mood regarding his loss of independence and persistent pain. He has socially withdrawn from friends since the amputation.",
    "imaging": "Pre-operative Doppler Ultrasound and Angiogram confirmed severe multi-level PVD in the right lower extremity. Post-operative radiographs of the right tibia/fibula show well-healing amputation site with no signs of osteomyelitis.",
