    "title": "Managing a Chronic Diabetic Foot Ulcer in a Retired Carpenter",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Matthews is a 68-year-old retired carpenter who presents with a non-healing ulcer on the plantar aspect of his right foot, noted for the last 6 weeks. The ulcer began as a small blister after walking in ill-fitting shoes but has progressively worsened despite basic wound care. John reports mild to moderate pain surrounding the ulcer, particularly at the ball of his foot, but admits to significant numbness and tingling in his feet for several years. On examination, there is a 3cm x 2cm ulcer with peri-wound erythema at the first metatarsal head. He ambulates with an antalgic gait, and inspection reveals atrophy of the intrinsic foot muscles and a collapsed longitudinal arch. Pulses are diminished but palpable. There is mild swelling, but no systemic symptoms.",
