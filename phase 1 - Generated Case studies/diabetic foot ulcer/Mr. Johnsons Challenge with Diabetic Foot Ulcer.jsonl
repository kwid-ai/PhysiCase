    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Challenge with Diabetic Foot Ulcer",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old retired accountant with a 15-year history of Type 2 Diabetes. Over the past 2 months, he has been experiencing a persistent sore on the plantar surface of his right foot. Initially, he noticed some redness and a small bump after a day of unusually long walking. He ignored it, attributing the discomfort to his new pair of shoes. However, when the bump grew into a persistent sore, he sought medical attention. The ulcer is about 2 cm in diameter with evidence of local infection, marked by mild erythema and surrounding edema. Mr. Johnson reports a constant dull ache (P1) at the site of the ulcer, particularly when walking. He denies any recent trauma to the area.",
