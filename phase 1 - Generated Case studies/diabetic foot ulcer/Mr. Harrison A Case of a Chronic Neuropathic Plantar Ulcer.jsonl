    "title": "Mr. Harrison: A Case of a Chronic Neuropathic Plantar Ulcer",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Robert Harrison is a 68-year-old retired factory foreman who presents to the outpatient physical therapy clinic via a referral from his endocrinologist. His chief complaint is a 'non-healing wound' on the sole of his left foot. Mr. Harrison reports first noticing drainage on his sock approximately 6 weeks ago. He does not recall a specific incident or trauma that would have caused the wound, which is a classic feature given his long-standing neuropathy. Upon self-inspection, he discovered a small, open sore over the ball of his foot. Despite his wife's attempts at daily cleaning and dressing, the wound has gradually increased in size and depth. He denies significant pain directly from the ulcer itself, but reports a secondary deep, aching pain in his midfoot and ankle, which he attributes to 'walking funny' to avoid pressure on the sore.",

    "aggrevating_factors": null,
    "picture": "Symptoms are at their best upon waking, before he has placed any weight on the foot. The secondary ache (P2) progressively worsens throughout the day in direct correlation with his activity level. He reports difficulty sleeping, not from the pain, but from anxiety about the wound and the discomfort of having to keep the limb elevated.",
    "easing_factors": "Complete non-weight bearing, elevating the leg, and using the removable cast walker that was recently provided by his physician.",
    "past_history": "History of 'minor nicks and scrapes' on his lower legs that have always been slow to heal. He fell two years ago, sustaining a mild ankle sprain on the contralateral (right) side, which resolved with rest over 8 weeks.",
    "medical_history": "Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus diagnosed 22 years ago, with a recent HbA1c of 8.9%, indicating suboptimal long-term glycemic control. Diagnosed with severe peripheral sensory neuropathy 7 years ago. Mild peripheral arterial disease (PAD) confirmed via an Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI) of 0.85 last year. Hypertension (HTN) and Hyperlipidemia, both reportedly managed with medication.",
    "medications": "Metformin, Insulin (Lantus), Lisinopril, Atorvastatin, Clopidogrel. He self-medicates for the foot ache with Acetaminophen, with minimal perceived benefit.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Harrison lives with his wife in a single-story home. Since retiring 3 years ago, his activity level has significantly decreased. He expresses frustration with his dietary restrictions and acknowledges inconsistent adherence to his blood glucose monitoring. His wife is his primary caregiver and is highly concerned about his condition.",
    "imaging": "Plain film radiographs of the left foot were taken last week. The report notes soft tissue swelling and demineralization around the first metatarsal head, but no definitive signs of acute osteomyelitis or Charcot arthropathy at this time. A follow-up MRI may be indicated if the wound fails to improve with offloading.",
