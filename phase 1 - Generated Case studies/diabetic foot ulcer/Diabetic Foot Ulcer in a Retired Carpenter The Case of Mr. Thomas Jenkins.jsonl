    "title": "Diabetic Foot Ulcer in a Retired Carpenter: The Case of Mr. Thomas Jenkins",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Thomas Jenkins is a 68-year-old retired carpenter with a 20-year history of type 2 diabetes mellitus. He presented to the outpatient clinic with a non-healing ulcer located on the plantar aspect of his left foot, just proximal to the heads of the first and second metatarsals. The patient reports noticing a small blister three weeks ago, which has since developed into an ulcer approximately 2.5 cm in diameter. He describes increased discomfort when walking and states that there is now visible redness, surrounding callus, and some serous discharge. He denies any fevers or chills but notes mild swelling in the left foot. Mr. Jenkins admits to inconsistent glycemic control and often walks barefoot at home. He also acknowledges reduced sensation in both feet for several years.",
