    "title": "Case of Alan with Neuromyelitis Optica",
    "clinical_history": "Alan is a 38-year-old software developer who initially presented six months ago with sudden onset of bilateral visual impairment, which he described as a 'blurred and foggy' vision, making it difficult for him to concentrate on his computer screen. This episode, mainly affecting both eyes, resolved after a few days with the help of oral corticosteroids. Recently, Alan experienced sudden weakness in his lower limbs, accompanied by numbness and tingling sensations. The weakness gradually worsened, affecting his ability to walk and complete daily chores. Alan reported intermittent bladder dysfunction and has had a few episodes of urinary incontinence over the past weeks.",
