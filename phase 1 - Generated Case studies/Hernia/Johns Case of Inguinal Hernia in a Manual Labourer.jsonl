He reports a noticeable bulge in the right groin region, which becomes more prominent when lifting heavy boxes at work or coughing. He describes a dull ache and a sense of heaviness in the area, particularly after prolonged standing or physical exertion. Occasionally, the pain radiates to the upper inner thigh but is absent at rest. He denies any bowel or urinary symptoms. There is no history of trauma. This is his first episode of such complaints.",
