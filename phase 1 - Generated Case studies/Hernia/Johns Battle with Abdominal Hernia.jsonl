    "title": "John's Battle with Abdominal Hernia",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 45-year-old software engineer who spends most of his day seated in front of a computer. He started noticing a mild discomfort in his lower abdomen about a month ago, which gradually progressed to pain especially when lifting heavy objects or coughing. He observes a noticeable bulge on the right side of his groin, which reduces when he is lying down. His symptoms worsen when he stands for prolonged periods or during physical exertion. He consumed over-the-counter pain relievers with minimal relief.",
