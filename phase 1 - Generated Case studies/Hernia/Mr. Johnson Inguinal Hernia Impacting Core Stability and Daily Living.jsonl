Over the last 4 weeks, he has experienced intermittent aching localized to the right inguinal region, exacerbated by physical exertion, coughing, or prolonged standing. His pain subsides at rest or when lying supine. On examination, a palpable, reducible mass is noted in the right inguinal region, which becomes prominent with Valsalva maneuver. He denies any nausea, vomiting, or systemic symptoms.",
