    "title": "Progressive Limb Weakness in a Middle-Aged Man: A Case of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Jason Turner is a 52-year-old male accountant who presented to the neurology clinic with complaints of progressive weakness in his left hand and forearm over the last 6 months. He reports difficulty gripping objects, frequent muscle cramping, and has noticed muscle twitching (fasciculations) in his upper limbs, primarily affecting the left side. Over the past 2 months, he has developed similar symptoms in the right hand and mild difficulty with walking due to weakness in his right ankle. He denies any sensory loss. Jason has lost approximately 5 kg unintentionally over the last three months and reports mild slurred speech developing in the past few weeks. Family has noticed that he is more fatigued in the evenings and has difficulty holding utensils at dinner. There is no family history of neuromuscular disorder.",
