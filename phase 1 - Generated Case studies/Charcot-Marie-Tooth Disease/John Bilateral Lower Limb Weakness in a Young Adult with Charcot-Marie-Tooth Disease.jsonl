    "title": "John: Bilateral Lower Limb Weakness in a Young Adult with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 24-year-old graduate student who presents with a progressive history of bilateral lower limb weakness and atrophy over the past 4 years. He reports frequent tripping, 'slapping' of his feet on the ground, and difficulty ascending stairs. There is a visible deformity in his feet described as high arches (pes cavus) and hammertoes, which have become more pronounced. The patient complains of distal calf muscle wasting, with particular weakness in foot dorsiflexion and eversion, resulting in bilateral foot drop. He also notes numbness and tingling in his feet and lower legs, but has less significant symptoms in his hands. He denies bowel or bladder dysfunction. John recently began using ankle-foot orthoses (AFOs) due to unsteadiness and to improve gait. There is no history of trauma. Family history is positive for similar symptoms in his father and paternal aunt.",
