    "title": "Case Study: Progressive Distal Muscle Weakness in a Young Adult with Charcot-Marie-Tooth Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Michael S., a 24-year-old male graduate student, reports a five-year history of progressive difficulty with walking and frequent tripping. He describes having had unusually high arches since adolescence and recently has noticed increasing weakness in his lower legs and hands. Over the past year, he has experienced difficulty rising onto his toes, frequent ankle sprains, and muscle cramps during moderate activity. His mother was diagnosed with a similar condition in her 40s. On examination, Michael displays bilateral foot drop, visible muscle atrophy in the anterior lower legs and hand intrinsics, and diminished deep tendon reflexes in the lower limbs. He experiences fatigue and mild, intermittent neuropathic pain in his feet after prolonged standing.",
