    "title": "Progressive Hand Dysfunction in a Patient with Scleroderma",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Dorothy Allen is a 48-year-old right-handed administrative assistant who presents with progressive tightening and pain in her hands over the past 18 months. She reports increasing difficulty with fine motor tasks and describes her skin as feeling 'thick' and 'stiff.' She notes intermittent pain and swelling in her fingers, particularly in the mornings. She also complains of significant sensitivity to cold, with color changes (white, blue, then red) in her fingers on exposure. Over the past 6 months, she has noticed a marked decrease in her grip strength and difficulty opening jars, writing, and buttoning her clothes. She denies trauma, but states that aches have extended to her wrists and forearms, and more recently, mild discomfort in her knees and ankles. She occasionally experiences heartburn and mild shortness of breath on exertion.",
