    "title": "James, a pianist with a gripping struggle against scleroderma",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 34-year-old professional pianist who started experiencing difficulties with his finger movements approximately 3/12 ago. He initially noticed a mild swelling and stiffness in his fingers, particularly in the mornings. Over time, the symptoms have worsened, affecting his ability to play piano, which he is required to do professionally. James also mentions developing thickened patches on the skin of his hands and forearms, which are now restricting his flexibility. He reports feelings of fatigue, particularly in the afternoons, and occasionally, shortness of breath. Lately, Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition associated with scleroderma, has caused painful fingers upon exposure to cold weather.",
