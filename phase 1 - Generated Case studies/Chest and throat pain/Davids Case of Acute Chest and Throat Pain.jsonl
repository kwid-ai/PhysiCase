    "title": "David's Case of Acute Chest and Throat Pain",
    "clinical_history": "David is a 42-year-old accountant who presented with sudden onset of left-sided chest and anterior throat pain while eating dinner three days ago. The pain was sharp and constricting, radiating from the upper chest to the lower aspect of his throat. He noted associated difficulty swallowing and mild shortness of breath, but no syncope or nausea. He denied any prior history of cardiac or respiratory issues. The pain is described as constant with intermittent spikes, especially on swallowing solids or taking a deep breath. No heartburn reported. At rest, the pain slightly eases but does not fully resolve. David reports the pain disrupted his sleep the first night but now mostly flares with movement or meals.",
