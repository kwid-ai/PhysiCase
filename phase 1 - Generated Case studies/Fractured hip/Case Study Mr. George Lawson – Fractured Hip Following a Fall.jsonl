    "title": "Case Study: Mr. George Lawson – Fractured Hip Following a Fall",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. George Lawson is an 81-year-old retired postal worker who lives independently. He was admitted to the emergency department following a mechanical fall at home. Mr. Lawson tripped over a rug in his hallway and landed directly on his left side. He immediately experienced severe left hip pain and was unable to bear weight. In the emergency room, physical examination revealed shortening and external rotation of the left lower limb. There was marked tenderness over the left hip and decreased range of motion due to pain. Radiographs confirmed a displaced intertrochanteric fracture of the left femur.",
