    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Harris is a 48-year-old IT analyst with a 20-year office career, presenting with a 4-month history of persistent, non-specific deep muscular aches primarily in the neck, upper trapezius, and interscapular region, alongside generalized fatigue and low mood. He reports difficulty initiating and maintaining sleep, decreased work performance, and diminished interest in hobbies. He describes a persistent sense of physical heaviness and tension, especially on waking and after long periods of desk work. Emotional stressors began after an organizational restructuring led to increased job insecurity, and his fatherâ€™s recent diagnosis with dementia further contributed to his current state.",
