    "title": "Depression Manifesting as Generalized Myalgia in a Middle-Aged Woman",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Ayesha Rahman, a 48-year-old administrative assistant, presents to physiotherapy at the request of her primary care physician due to persistent, diffuse muscle aches and reduced physical function over the past 6 months. She reports worsening fatigue, generalized muscle soreness—particularly in the upper back, shoulders, and thighs—with no clear traumatic or mechanical onset. On further questioning, Mrs. Rahman acknowledges decreased motivation, loss of interest in previously enjoyable activities such as gardening, and disturbed sleep with early morning awakening. She has trouble concentrating at work and describes significant feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness. She notes that her muscle discomfort worsens in the early morning and often lasts throughout the day, making physical activity and social engagement difficult. She denies any preceding acute injury, fever, or joint swelling. Her primary pain complaint is persistent dull muscular aches (P1), with intermittent tension-type headaches (P2) in the late afternoon.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Prolonged inactivity or sitting, stressful conversations, overexertion, and extended work hours exacerbate her symptoms. Symptoms tend to worsen with poor sleep or emotional distress.",

    "easing_factors": "Mild, regular physical activity (gentle walking, stretching), supportive family interactions, brief daytime naps, and warm showers provide partial relief. She notes minor improvement on days with structure and routine.",
    "past_history": "No history of recent trauma or musculoskeletal injury. She notes similar, but milder symptoms of low mood during previous episodes of significant life stress, but these never required medical intervention.",
    "medical_history": "Borderline hypertension, well controlled. BMI 31. No diabetes or autoimmune disease. No prior psychiatric diagnosis.",
    "medications": "Started on sertraline 25mg OD by her family physician one month ago. Occasionally takes paracetamol for headache. No other regular medication.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with her husband; two grown children have recently moved abroad for studies, contributing to her sense of isolation. She has no history of substance abuse. She is the primary caregiver for her elderly mother, which has added to her daily stress and responsibilities.",
    "imaging": "None performed; physical and neurological exams are unremarkable except mild diffuse muscle tenderness.",
