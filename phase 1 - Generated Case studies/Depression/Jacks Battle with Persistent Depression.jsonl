    "title": "Jack's Battle with Persistent Depression",
    "clinical_history": "Jack is a 42-year-old IT professional working from home. Over the past 6 months, Jack has experienced progressively worsening feelings of sadness, lack of motivation, and general disinterest in activities he once enjoyed. He notes difficulty in concentrating, frequent fatigue, and a sense of hopelessness. These symptoms have impacted both his personal and professional life, leading to decreased work performance and withdrawal from friends and family. Jack mentions having trouble sleeping, often waking up in the middle of the night and taking hours to fall back asleep, which leaves him feeling unrested in the morning.",
