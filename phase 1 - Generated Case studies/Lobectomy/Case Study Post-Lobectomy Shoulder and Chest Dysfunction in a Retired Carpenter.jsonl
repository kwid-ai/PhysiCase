    "title": "Case Study: Post-Lobectomy Shoulder and Chest Dysfunction in a Retired Carpenter",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. George Allen is a 68-year-old retired carpenter who underwent a right upper lobectomy six weeks ago for early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma. The surgery was performed via open thoracotomy. Since discharge, George complains of persistent right-sided chest and shoulder pain, reduced shoulder range of motion, and difficulty taking deep breaths or engaging in activities such as washing, dressing, or reaching overhead. He reports muscle weakness, notable fatigue, and an ongoing fear of movement due to pain. He denies fever, acute respiratory distress, or other complications, but expresses concern about slow progress. Pain is worse with coughing, deep inspiration, or arm movement. He uses a hand-held fan for breathlessness, and a prescribed incentive spirometer.",
