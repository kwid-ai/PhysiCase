    "title": "Case Study: Post-Lobectomy Shoulder and Thoracic Dysfunction in Mr. Ram Singh",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Ram Singh, a 62-year-old retired civil engineer, underwent a left upper lobectomy via thoracotomy 4 weeks ago for early-stage non-small cell lung carcinoma. He was previously independent in all activities of daily living and engaged in regular walks and yoga. Post-surgery, Mr. Singh reports persistent left-sided chest, upper back, and shoulder pain, which increased with movement and breathing. He also experiences a reduced range of motion in his left shoulder with mild swelling and a sensation of stiffness. He mentions significant fatigue and mild shortness of breath, more pronounced during activity. Sleep is disturbed due to pain when lying on the affected side.",

    "picture": "Patient localizes primary pain to surgical site over left thoracic wall and adjacent shoulder, occasionally radiating posteriorly to scapular region.",

    "past_history": "No significant prior surgery; history of controlled hypertension for 10 years. No prior shoulder or thoracic pain.",
    "medical_history": "Mild hypertension, no diabetes or other chronic illness. Recent thoracotomy for pulmonary neoplasm.",
