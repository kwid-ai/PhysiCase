    "clinical_history": "Mr. James Johnson is a 64-year-old retired firefighter who underwent a right upper lobectomy 3 weeks ago due to early-stage lung cancer. Prior to the surgery, Mr. Johnson was in relatively good health, although he had a history of smoking for 20 years, having quit 15 years ago. Post-operatively, he has been experiencing difficulty with deep breathing and has noted pain upon inspiration which has limited his ability to engage in physical activities. He reports increased tiredness by mid-afternoon and is finding it hard to resume his daily routine, including his walks around the neighborhood.",
