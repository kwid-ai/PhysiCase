    "title": "Acute Lateral Ankle Sprain in a Recreational Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 34-year-old recreational tennis player who sustained an injury to his right ankle during a doubles match three days ago. While chasing a wide ball, he landed awkwardly on the outside of his foot and immediately felt a sharp pain along the outer aspect of his right ankle. He was unable to continue playing and noted swelling developing rapidly within the hour. He has been able to weight-bear with significant discomfort but walks with an obvious limp. James reports that the ankle feels unstable, especially when negotiating stairs or uneven ground. He did not hear a pop but experienced moderate bruising by the following day. He denies any previous major ankle injuries.",
