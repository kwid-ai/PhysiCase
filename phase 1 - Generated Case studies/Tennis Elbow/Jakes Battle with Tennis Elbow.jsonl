    "title": "Jake's Battle with Tennis Elbow",
    "clinical_history": "Jake is a 42-year-old software engineer who spends most of his day at a desk. He started experiencing pain on the lateral aspect of his right elbow about three months ago. Jake began a new tennis regimen with increased frequency, playing 4-5 times a week. About a month after the increased activity, he noted a sharp pain in his right elbow after an intense game. The pain appeared with specific movements, such as lifting his coffee mug or typing for extended periods. Jake reports the pain as (P1) a sharp, burning sensation directly at the lateral elbow and (P2) a secondary aching that radiates into his forearm, particularly when gripping objects tightly.",
