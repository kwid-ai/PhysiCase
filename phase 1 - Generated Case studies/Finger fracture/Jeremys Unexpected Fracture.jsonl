    "title": "Jeremy's Unexpected Fracture",
    "clinical_history": "Jeremy, a 22-year-old college soccer player, presented to the clinic with swelling and pain in his right index finger. Two days ago, while practicing for a major tournament, he accidentally jammed his finger against a teammate's knee while trying to steal the ball. He noticed immediate pain and, in the hours following, swelling and bruising on the affected finger. Despite the discomfort, he completed the practice session by taping his finger to his index finger, falsely assuming it was a minor sprain. The following day, typing notes for his course, he found it frustratingly tender and decided to seek professional advice.",
