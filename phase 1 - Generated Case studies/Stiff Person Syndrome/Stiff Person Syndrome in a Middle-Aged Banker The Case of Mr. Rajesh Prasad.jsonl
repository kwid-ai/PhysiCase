    "title": "Stiff Person Syndrome in a Middle-Aged Banker: The Case of Mr. Rajesh Prasad",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Rajesh Prasad is a 45-year-old male, employed as a senior banker, who presents with progressive stiffness and painful spasms involving his axial and proximal limb muscles over the past 8 months. He first noted tightness in his lower back, which gradually extended to his abdominal muscles and thighs. Over the past 3 months, he experienced frequent, severe spasms triggered by sudden noises and emotional stress, at times resulting in transient difficulty walking or standing. His gait has become rigid and cautious, and he describes worsening nocturnal stiffness that disrupts sleep. There is no history of trauma or recent illness. No bowel or bladder complaints. He reports increasing anxiety due to anticipating spasms in public settings.",
