    "title": "Mark's Muscular Challenge",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 30-year-old software engineer who has recently taken up hiking on weekends. He presents with complaints of cramping muscle pain and stiffness during his hikes, especially in the thighs and calves. He notes that the pain becomes unbearable and forces him to stop and rest. Interestingly, the pain often subsides after a brief rest, allowing him to resume hiking, albeit cautiously. He experiences muscle weakness with exertion which improves when he slows down his pace or stops entirely.",
