    "title": "Case Study: Exercise-Induced Muscle Pain in a Young Adult with McArdle Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Isaac is a 24-year-old university student who presents with complaints of recurrent muscle cramps and profound fatigue during moderate-intensity physical activity, most notably during group sports and brisk walking. He reports that since adolescence, he has been unable to keep pace with his peers during physical education classes, often experiencing severe thigh and calf cramps within 5-10 minutes of exertion. Occasionally, he experiences 'second wind'â€”after resting briefly during activity, his stamina and symptoms improve for a short period. He denies any pain at rest and has not noted significant weakness between episodes, but describes episodes of dark-coloured urine after more strenuous activity, which he now tries to avoid. He works part-time in a library and lives a sedentary lifestyle due to his symptoms.",

    "medical_history": "No chronic illnesses. No familial musculoskeletal conditions reported, but an older cousin has similar exercise intolerance.",
    "medications": "None regularly. Takes ibuprofen 200 mg orally as needed post-activity for soreness (rarely needed).",
    "personal_history": "Single, living with roommates. Non-smoker, does not drink alcohol. Studies computer science. Avoids most sports and vigorous activities due to symptoms, which has affected his social life and confidence.",
