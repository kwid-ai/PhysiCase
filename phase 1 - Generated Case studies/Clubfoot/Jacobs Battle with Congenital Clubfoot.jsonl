He underwent corrective surgery at 3 months old followed by serial casting until 8 months of age. Jacob's feet have shown significant improvement post-surgery, but he continues to have residual, mild stiffness in the ankle joints. While Jacob actively engages in nursery school activities, he sometimes struggles with prolonged standing or running.",
