    "clinical_history": "Noah is a 3-month-old male infant presenting with his mother for a routine follow-up. He was born at term via normal vaginal delivery after an uneventful pregnancy; birth weight was 3.2 kg. Immediately after birth, a persistent inward turning of his right foot was noted. Physical examination confirmed the right foot displays plantarflexion at the ankle, inversion at the subtalar joint, and adduction of the forefoot. Mild calf muscle atrophy is visible in the right leg compared to the left. Noah's mother states there are no signs of pain during handling, but he is occasionally irritable when pressure is applied to the right foot during diaper changes or stretching. He has been receiving serial casting (Ponseti method) initiated at 1 week of age, with weekly changes. His mother reports improved correction but still observes limited dorsiflexion and a tendency for the foot to revert if left unsupported for several hours.",
