    "title": "James – Adult Spastic Cerebral Palsy with Lower Limb Spasticity",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 38-year-old accountant with a known diagnosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy since early childhood. He ambulates independently with the use of bilateral forearm crutches. Over the past 3 months, James has noticed increasing difficulty with transfers and prolonged walking. He reports progressive tightness and spasms, particularly in both hamstrings and adductors, with associated pain and increased fatigue by midday. His gait is characterized by scissoring, crouched posture, and toe-walking. While he is still able to independently manage self-care and work responsibilities, his walking distance and speed have declined. He is concerned about worsening function and increasing falls—experiencing three non-injurious falls in the past month.",

    "past_history": "Premature birth at 30 weeks, spent 2 months in NICU due to respiratory distress. Multiple orthopedic interventions in childhood for Achilles tendon lengthening and adductor release at ages 7 and 12. No significant surgeries in adulthood. Attends physiotherapy intermittently.",

    "medications": "Baclofen 10mg twice daily (antispasmodic), PRN ibuprofen 400mg (<3x/week, mostly post-physiotherapy), Salbutamol inhaler as needed.",
