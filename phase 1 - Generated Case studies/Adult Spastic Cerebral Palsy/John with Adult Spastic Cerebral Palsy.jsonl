    "title": "John with Adult Spastic Cerebral Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 38-year-old software developer who was diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy at birth. Over the years he has been able to maintain a high degree of independence despite his condition. He experiences increased muscle tone and stiffness primarily in his lower limbs, mainly affecting his right leg more than his left. He walks with a pronounced spastic gait and uses a cane for stability during long distances. Recently, John has noted an increase in muscle spasms and pain, particularly after long hours of sitting at his desk, or after attempting to engage in physical exercises like cycling.",
