    "title": "Case Study: Early Functional Decline in a 48-Year-Old with Early-Onset Alzheimer’s Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel J., a 48-year-old IT project manager, presents with his spouse to the outpatient clinic. Over the past year, he has demonstrated increasing forgetfulness, difficulty managing complex tasks at work, and misplacing items frequently. His spouse notes he has become easily frustrated and has struggled to recognize the purpose of familiar objects. Gradually, he has developed balance issues, subtle unsteadiness when rising from a chair, and increasing difficulty coordinating walking, resulting in near-falls when navigating stairs. His physical complaints are primarily non-painful muscle fatigue in the lower limbs after minimal ambulation. Daniel’s symptoms have progressively worsened, impacting his capacity for daily self-care activities such as dressing and bathing. He has no known family history of dementia.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Fatigue and muscle heaviness are aggravated by extended walking (more than 10-15 minutes), stair climbing, attempting new or unfamiliar tasks, and periods of high sensory stimulation or distraction.",

    "easing_factors": "Resting in a seated position, engaging in familiar, structured routines, use of verbal and visual cues from caregivers, gentle stretching exercises.",
    "past_history": "No significant past orthopedic or neurologic injuries. Negative for prior concussions, strokes, or musculoskeletal trauma.",
    "medical_history": "Mild hypertension, well controlled with medication. No prior psychiatric illness. No diabetes or cardiovascular events.",
    "medications": "Donepezil 10 mg daily (for cognitive symptoms), amlodipine 5 mg daily (for hypertension), Vitamin D supplementation.",
    "personal_history": "Non-smoker, moderate alcohol use (socially on weekends), married with two children in college. Previously physically active (cycling, hiking), but has decreased activity in recent months due to progressive symptoms. Reports increased anxiety and occasional low mood related to loss of independence and occupational disengagement.",
    "imaging": "MRI brain (12 months ago) showed mild diffuse cortical atrophy more notable in temporal and parietal regions, consistent with neurodegenerative disease. No acute findings. No musculoskeletal imaging performed.",
