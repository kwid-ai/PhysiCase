    "title": "Case Study: Progressive Functional Decline in a Patient with Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Robert Vance is a 62-year-old retired civil engineer referred for physical therapy by his primary care physician. His wife, who is his full-time caregiver, accompanies him to the evaluation. The primary reason for referral is a notable decline in mobility, balance, and an increasing frequency of falls, with the most recent one occurring two weeks ago. Mr. Vance presents with a stooped posture, a shuffling gait with reduced step length, and significant difficulty with initiation of movement. His wife reports that he often appears 'frozen' when trying to stand up or start walking. He requires verbal cueing and physical assistance for most transfers. During the initial assessment, he demonstrates difficulty following multi-step commands and his attention wanders frequently. His primary complaint is not of pain, but a profound sense of unsteadiness and fear of moving.",

            "affected_area": "This is not a pain complaint, but the patient's primary issue. It pertains to a loss of motor planning (apraxia) and balance, affecting the entire neuromotor system. This manifests as generalized instability, shuffling gait, and frequent loss of balance. The patient has difficulty articulating this, but his wife describes it as his main problem.",

    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Dual-tasking (e.g., walking while talking), navigating around obstacles or through doorways, turning, walking on uneven or carpeted surfaces, and low-light environments. Symptoms are significantly worse during periods of fatigue or confusion.",
    "picture": "Mr. Vance's day is marked by significant variability. Mornings are his most challenging period; he is very stiff and slow, requiring up to an hour to get out of bed, use the restroom, and get dressed, with considerable assistance from his wife. He may have a period of better function in the late morning to early afternoon. However, by late afternoon, a 'sundowning' effect is prominent. His confusion, agitation, and motor impairments worsen, leading to a higher risk of falls. He often paces restlessly in the evenings. Sleep is fragmented, with frequent awakenings.",
    "easing_factors": "A quiet, well-lit environment with minimal clutter. Direct, one-step verbal cues. Use of a standard walker (though he often forgets to use it). Physical contact and guidance from his wife. Structured routine.",
    "past_history": "Generally healthy and very active prior to diagnosis. Enjoyed hiking and cycling. History of a left rotator cuff repair 10 years ago with full recovery. No other significant musculoskeletal history.",
    "medical_history": "Formal diagnosis of Early-Onset Alzheimer's Disease 2 years ago by a neurologist. Mild Hypertension, managed with medication. Recent fall 2/52 ago, assessed in the emergency department; radiographs were negative for fracture.",
    "medications": "Donepezil (Aricept), Memantine (Namenda), Lisinopril, Acetaminophen PRN for hip/knee pain.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Vance is a retired civil engineer who was forced into early retirement due to his cognitive decline. He lives with his wife in a two-story home. The stairs have become a significant safety concern. He was formerly an avid reader and enjoyed woodworking, but no longer engages in these hobbies due to apraxia and lack of initiative. His wife is his sole caregiver and reports significant caregiver burnout and stress.",
    "imaging": "Brain MRI (2 years ago): Showed generalized and medial temporal lobe atrophy, consistent with the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease. Right Hip and Knee X-rays (2 weeks ago): No acute osseous abnormality.",
