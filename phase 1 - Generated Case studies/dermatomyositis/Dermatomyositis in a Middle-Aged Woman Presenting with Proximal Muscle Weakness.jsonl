    "title": "Dermatomyositis in a Middle-Aged Woman Presenting with Proximal Muscle Weakness",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Deborah L., a 47-year-old accountant, presents to the outpatient physical therapy clinic with complaints of progressively worsening weakness in her proximal muscles over the last 3 months. She notes difficulty in rising from chairs, climbing stairs, and lifting her arms overhead to wash her hair or reach high shelves. She first noticed increasing muscle fatigue after a weekend hiking trip, where she struggled to keep pace with her friends. In the past month, she developed a reddish-purple rash on her upper eyelids and over the knuckles of both hands. She reports mild pain but primarily describes profound muscle fatigue. No previous similar episodes. No trauma reported. She experiences morning stiffness, but it tends to improve slightly as the day progresses. She continues to work but has scaled back physical activities and relies on her husband for household chores.",
