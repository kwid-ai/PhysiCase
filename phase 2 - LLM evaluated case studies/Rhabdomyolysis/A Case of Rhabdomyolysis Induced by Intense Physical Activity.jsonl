    "clinical_history": "A 32-year-old male, who is an amateur marathon runner, presented to the clinic with a 2-day history of severe muscle pain and weakness. He reported completing a particularly grueling training session 2 days prior, which included an intense 10-mile run uphill. He noted that he did not adequately hydrate during the run and consumed only minimal fluids post-exercise. Following the run, he experienced increasing pain and stiffness in his lower extremities, which progressed to include his upper body. He also reported dark-colored urine and decreased urine output.",
