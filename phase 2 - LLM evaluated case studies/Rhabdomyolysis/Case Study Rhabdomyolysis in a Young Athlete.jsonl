    "clinical_history": "A 25-year-old male collegiate football player presented to the emergency department with a 2-day history of severe muscle pain, fatigue, and dark-colored urine. He reported participating in an intense training session 3 days prior, which included rigorous exercises and prolonged running in hot weather conditions. He initially attributed his symptoms to delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) but sought medical attention when his symptoms worsened and he noticed decreased urine output.",
