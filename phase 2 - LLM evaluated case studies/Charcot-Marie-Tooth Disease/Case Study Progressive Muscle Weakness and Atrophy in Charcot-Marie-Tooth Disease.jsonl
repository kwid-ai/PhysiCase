    "clinical_history": "A 35-year-old male, Mr. Thompson, presented with a 5-year history of progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in his lower extremities. He reported difficulty walking and frequent tripping over his own feet. He also experienced numbness and tingling sensations in his feet and hands.
