    "title": "James, the Marathon Runner with Achilles Tendinopathy",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 34-year-old professional marathon runner. He initially started experiencing discomfort in his right heel approximately 3/52 weeks ago. At first, James attributed the soreness to the increased intensity of his training regimen as he prepared for an upcoming marathon. However, the pain progressed to a persistent ache, particularly upon waking in the morning. Despite continuing his training, James has noted a sharp pain during his runs, specifically when pushing off or after running long distances. He describes the pain as a constant, deep ache with intermittent, more severe pain during certain movements.",
