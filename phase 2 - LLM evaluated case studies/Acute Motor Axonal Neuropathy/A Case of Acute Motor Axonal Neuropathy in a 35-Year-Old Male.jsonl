    "clinical_history": "A 35-year-old male, who works as a software engineer, presented with a 5-day history of progressive weakness in his lower limbs. He initially noticed difficulty walking and standing from a seated position, which rapidly progressed to an inability to ambulate without assistance. He reports that the weakness started in his legs and has been symmetrical. The patient also complains of a 2-day history of numbness and tingling in his hands and feet. He has no recent history of travel, fever, or illness.",
