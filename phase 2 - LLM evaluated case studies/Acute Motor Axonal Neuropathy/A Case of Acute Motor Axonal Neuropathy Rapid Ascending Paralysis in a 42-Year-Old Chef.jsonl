    "title": "A Case of Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy: Rapid Ascending Paralysis in a 42-Year-Old Chef",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. David Chen, a 42-year-old executive chef, presents to the emergency department with a 4-day history of rapidly progressing, symmetrical weakness. The onset began with a 'heavy' feeling in his ankles and feet, causing him to stumble at work. Within 24 hours, the weakness ascended to his knees and thighs, making it impossible for him to stand from a seated position without using his arms. Over the subsequent 48 hours, he developed significant weakness in his wrists and hands, rendering him unable to hold a knife or even a phone. He reports no significant sensory changes, such as numbness or tingling, and no bladder or bowel incontinence. His wife notes that his breathing has appeared more shallow over the last day. The patient recalls a significant bout of gastroenteritis, which he attributed to 'bad seafood', approximately 10 days prior to the onset of his neurological symptoms.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Any attempt at active movement, including rolling in bed, attempting to sit up, or using his arms for self-care. The feeling of profound weakness and fatigue is overwhelming with minimal exertion. Sustained positions without support also increase the muscular ache.",

    "easing_factors": "Complete rest, supportive positioning with pillows to offload joints, passive range of motion administered by nursing staff. The administration of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) has begun to stabilize the progression of weakness.",
    "past_history": "No significant past medical history. Mr. Chen has always been physically active, working long hours on his feet in a demanding kitchen environment. No prior neurological events or chronic illnesses reported. All immunizations are up to date.",
    "medical_history": "Patient was admitted to the hospital and diagnosed with Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy (AMAN), a variant of Guillain-Barr\u00c3\u00a9 Syndrome. A lumbar puncture revealed albuminocytologic dissociation (elevated protein with normal white cell count). Nerve conduction studies showed markedly reduced or absent compound motor action potentials (CMAPs) with preserved sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs), confirming an axonal variant.",
    "medications": "Currently receiving a 5-day course of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg). Prophylactic enoxaparin (Lovenox) for DVT prevention. Paracetamol for muscle aches as needed.",
    "personal_history": "Married, father of two teenage children. He is the owner and head chef of a successful local restaurant, a career that is both his livelihood and passion, requiring significant physical stamina and fine motor skill. He does not smoke and consumes alcohol socially (1-2 glasses of wine per week).",
    "imaging": "An MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine was performed upon admission to rule out cord compression or transverse myelitis; results were unremarkable.",
