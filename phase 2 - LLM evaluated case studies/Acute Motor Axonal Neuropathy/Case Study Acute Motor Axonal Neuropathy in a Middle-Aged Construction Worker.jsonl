    "title": "Case Study: Acute Motor Axonal Neuropathy in a Middle-Aged Construction Worker",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. John Takeda is a 48-year-old male who works as a foreman in the construction industry. Approximately 12 days ago, he experienced a sudden onset of symmetrical weakness in his lower limbs, progressing rapidly to involve his upper limbs. Three days prior to symptom onset, he had a mild gastrointestinal infection with loose bowel movements and cramping, which resolved spontaneously. He reports difficulty climbing stairs, frequent tripping, and an inability to lift his arms above shoulder level. There is minimal sensory disturbance, but he notes severe muscle fatigue. No visual, speech, or swallowing difficulties. On examination, marked flaccid paralysis is present in both lower limbs, especially the anterior tibialis and quadriceps, with significant weakness in the upper limb flexors. Deep tendon reflexes are absent throughout. Cranial nerves are intact. He was hospitalized for observation as symptoms escalated over 48 hours.",
