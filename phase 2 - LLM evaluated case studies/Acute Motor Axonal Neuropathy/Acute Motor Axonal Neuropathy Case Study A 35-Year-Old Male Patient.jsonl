    "clinical_history": "A 35-year-old male patient presented with a 5-day history of progressive weakness in his lower limbs. He initially experienced fatigue and heaviness in his legs, which rapidly progressed to difficulty walking and standing. The patient reported that he had a recent history of diarrhea and upper respiratory tract infection 2 weeks prior to the onset of his current symptoms.",
