    "title": "James, a young man with Cerebral Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 22-year-old man who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy shortly after birth. He presents with spasticity predominantly affecting his lower limbs, specifically targeting the muscle groups of the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gastrocnemius. James uses a combination of a wheelchair for longer distances and a walker for short walks around his home. He attends a college with disability accommodations but is struggling with increased muscle tightness and pain which he rates as disruptive to his daily activities.",

    "easing_factors": "stretching exercises, warm baths, and massage therapy",
    "past_history": "James was born prematurely and had a complicated birth, requiring intensive care. Early developmental milestones were delayed, and he was diagnosed with spastic cerebral palsy at 18 months. He has undergone multiple surgeries to address contractures over the years.",
    "medical_history": "No known allergies. Has a history of seizures during childhood which are now well-controlled with medication.",
    "medications": "Baclofen for muscle spasticity, Lamotrigine for seizure control",
    "personal_history": "James is a determined young man who is currently studying computer science. He lives with his parents who are very supportive. He enjoys video games and is part of an online community. His social circle is mostly virtual due to mobility challenges but he is well-connected online.",
    "imaging": "Recent MRI shows white matter changes consistent with his diagnosis but no new findings.",
