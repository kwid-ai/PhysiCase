    "clinical_history": "Samuel is a 7-year-old boy, referred to the physical therapy outpatient department with concerns regarding difficulty walking, frequent tripping, and delayed gross motor skills. Born prematurely at 30 weeks, Samuel spent several weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit. Early on, he was noted to have delayed motor milestones and increased stiffness in his legs. Parents report frequent toe-walking, scissoring gait, and difficulty keeping up with peers during play. Examination reveals increased muscle tone (spasticity) predominantly in the bilateral lower limbs, with both hamstrings and gastrocnemius (calf) muscles affected. He displays brisk deep tendon reflexes, limited active range of motion at the knees and ankles, and bilateral equinus gait. There is no history of seizures or cognitive deficits, but Samuel sometimes complains of muscle soreness after prolonged walking or running.",

    "easing_factors": "gentle stretching routines, warm baths, assisted standing frames, and regular rest periods. Samuel finds his night splints helpful to reduce morning stiffness.",
    "past_history": "History of prematurity (30 weeks) with initial respiratory distress syndrome; received neonatal physical therapy interventions during 1st and 2nd years. Persistent motor delays (sitting at 10 months, walking at 22 months). No history of trauma or other significant illnesses.",
    "medical_history": "No seizure disorders. Occasional constipation managed with dietary measures. Immunizations up-to-date. No prior surgeries.",
    "medications": "Baclofen syrup 10 mg twice daily for spasticity. Occasional paracetamol for muscle soreness.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with both parents and an older sibling. Attends regular school with a tailored Individualized Education Program (IEP). Enjoys reading and playing video games; finds playground activities and PE challenging due to motor limitations. Family is supportive and attends regular therapy sessions with him.",
    "imaging": "Brain MRI (performed at age 2) showed periventricular leukomalacia, consistent with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. Recent hip X-rays show no subluxation.",
