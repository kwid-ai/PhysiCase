    "clinical_history": "Meet John, a 45-year-old male who underwent a below-knee amputation (BKA) of his left leg due to a traumatic injury sustained in a motorcycle accident 6 months ago. He has a history of phantom limb pain and residual limb pain. John is currently experiencing difficulty with prosthetic use, reporting issues with balance, mobility, and pain management. He has been referred to physical therapy to improve his functional abilities and reduce pain.",
