    "title": "Rotator Cuff Injury Case Study: A 45-Year-Old Male with Shoulder Pain",
    "clinical_history": "A 45-year-old male, who works as a construction worker, presents with a 3-week history of right shoulder pain. He reports that the pain started after a fall while working on a scaffolding at a construction site. He felt a sudden sharp pain in his shoulder and was unable to move his arm. He has been experiencing pain and stiffness in his shoulder since then, which has been affecting his daily activities and sleep. He has difficulty lifting his arm above 90 degrees and has weakness in his shoulder, particularly when trying to lift objects or perform overhead activities.",
