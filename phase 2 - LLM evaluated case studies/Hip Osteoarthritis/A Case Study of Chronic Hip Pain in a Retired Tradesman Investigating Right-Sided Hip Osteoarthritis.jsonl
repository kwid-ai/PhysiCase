    "title": "A Case Study of Chronic Hip Pain in a Retired Tradesman: Investigating Right-Sided Hip Osteoarthritis",
    "clinical_history": "Arthur is a 68-year-old retired carpenter who presents with a gradual, insidious onset of right hip pain over the past 3 years. The pain was initially intermittent, mostly noticeable after long days of working in his garden or woodworking shop. However, over the last 6 months, the pain has become more constant and has started to significantly limit his daily function. He describes a primary deep, 'toothache-like' pain in his right groin (P1) which sometimes radiates down the front of his thigh towards his knee. He also reports a secondary aching pain over the side of his hip (P2), especially when he has been walking for a while. He notes significant stiffness in the morning, which takes at least an hour to 'loosen up'. He has difficulty with tasks like putting on his socks and shoes and getting in and out of his car. He has started using a walking stick he found in his garage for longer walks, which he feels provides some security and eases the pain.",

    "easing_factors": "Short periods of rest, lying down with a pillow under his knees, using a heat pack on the hip in the evenings, and the use of his walking stick. Over-the-counter pain relievers provide moderate, temporary relief.",
    "past_history": "History of a fall from a step ladder approximately 10 years ago, landing heavily on his right side. He was bruised and sore for several weeks but did not seek medical attention as the pain resolved. He played amateur football until his early 30s. No other significant musculoskeletal injuries.",
    "medical_history": "Generally in good health. Diagnosed with mild hypertension 5 years ago, which is well-controlled with medication. He has a Body Mass Index (BMI) of 29, having gained approximately 20 pounds since retirement.",
    "medications": "Lisinopril 10mg daily for hypertension. Takes Ibuprofen 400mg as needed (prn) for hip pain, usually 1-2 times per day. Has tried glucosamine supplements in the past with no perceived benefit.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with his wife in a two-story home. They have two adult children who live nearby. He was a very active individual prior to the escalation of his hip pain, enjoying gardening, woodworking, and walking his dog. He is now frustrated by his physical limitations and expresses concern about becoming a burden on his wife. His goal is to be able to walk his dog for 30 minutes and work in his garden without severe pain.",
    "imaging": "Antero-posterior (AP) and lateral X-rays of the right hip were performed 2 months ago. The radiology report indicates moderate to severe degenerative changes, characterized by a significant loss of superior joint space, subchondral sclerosis, and prominent osteophyte formation around the femoral head and acetabular rim, consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.",
