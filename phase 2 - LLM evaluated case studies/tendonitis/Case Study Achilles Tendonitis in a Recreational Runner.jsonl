    "clinical_history": "A 35-year-old male recreational runner presents with a 3-week history of pain and stiffness in the posterior aspect of his right ankle. He reports a gradual onset of symptoms, which have worsened over time, particularly with running and jumping activities. The patient has been running 3 times a week for the past year, but recently increased his mileage and intensity. He experiences pain and stiffness in the morning, which improves with activity, but worsens with prolonged running.",
