    "title": "Mr. Harold B.: Functional Decline and Mobility Issues in a Patient with Moderate Alzheimer Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Harold B. is an 81-year-old retired accountant, admitted for assessment due to increasing difficulty with mobility and recurrent falls within the home. Over the past 18 months, family members have noticed progressively worsening memory impairment, difficulty following instructions, and reliance on assistance to perform activities of daily living. In the past 6 months, his daughter reports episodes of wandering, frequent tripping, and trouble initiating movement, particularly when rising from a chair or turning corners. Mr. B. exhibits generalized muscle weakness, most notable in the proximal lower limb muscles, with a shuffling gait and decreased balance. Although he sometimes complains of a dull ache in the lower back and thighs, his ability to reliably communicate pain levels is variable due to cognitive impairment. He requires increasing support with personal care and has difficulty participating in exercise routines. There is no history of recent trauma, but he has sustained minor soft tissue injuries to the legs from previous falls.",
