    "title": "Isolated Proximal Phalanx Fracture of the Right Index Finger in a Recreational Basketball Player",
    "clinical_history": "Jacob, a 28-year-old right-handed graphic designer and recreational basketball player, presented with acute pain, swelling, and decreased mobility in his right index finger after jamming it against another player\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s hand during a game four days ago. Immediate swelling and bruising developed at the base of the index finger. He attempted to apply ice and self-splint with minimal relief. Jacob now reports difficulties with fine dexterous tasks at work, gripping objects, and notes increased pain with any attempts at active finger flexion or extension. There is no numbness or tingling; however, he is concerned about ongoing stiffness and the potential for long-term impairment.",
