    "clinical_history": "Jacob is an 8-year-old male referred to the clinic by his pediatrician for assessment and ongoing management of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy. He was born prematurely at 31 weeks gestation via C-section due to maternal pre-eclampsia. Initial NICU stay of 5 weeks; neonatal course complicated by mild intraventricular hemorrhage. Parents report delayed motor milestones: sitting unsupported at 15 months, walking at 3 years with a walker. Currently ambulates short distances indoors with a posterior walker, exhibiting pronounced bilateral lower limb spasticity, scissoring gait, and toe-walking. Recurrent falls (1\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2 times per week) are noted, typically during transitions or while fatigued. Jacob attends mainstream school with individualized support. He experiences muscular tightness and pain, notably in the hamstrings and gastrocnemius, especially during physical activity and rapid growth spurts, impacting participation in PE and outdoor play.",
