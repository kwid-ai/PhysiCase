    "title": "Mark's Boutonniere Deformity Journey",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 34-year-old computer engineer who spends most of his day working on the keyboard. About 4 weeks ago, while playing basketball, he had a sudden pain after an opponent's ball pass directly hit his left hand. Since then, he's noticed the ring finger of his left hand is unable to fully straighten at the middle joint, though it overextends at the tip. Despite minor swelling and tenderness, Mark continued to manage tasks albeit with difficulty, especially typing, which is a critical part of his job.",
