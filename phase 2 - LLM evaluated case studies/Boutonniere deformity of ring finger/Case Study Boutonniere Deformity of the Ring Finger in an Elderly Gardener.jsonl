    "title": "Case Study: Boutonniere Deformity of the Ring Finger in an Elderly Gardener",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Walter Hughes is a 68-year-old retired school principal and avid gardener who presents with a 3-week history of deformity and swelling of his right ring finger following a minor laceration sustained while pruning rose bushes. He initially managed the wound at home. Within days, Walter noticed increasing swelling and difficulty extending the middle joint (PIP) of his finger while the tip (DIP) became hyperextended. He reports pain and stiffness, especially when grasping tools or making a fist. On examination, there is evident flexion at the PIP and hyperextension at the DIP of the right ring finger, with tenderness and swelling localized to the PIP region. He denies numbness or tingling in the hand. Functionally, he struggles to grip objects, limiting his gardening activities significantly.",
