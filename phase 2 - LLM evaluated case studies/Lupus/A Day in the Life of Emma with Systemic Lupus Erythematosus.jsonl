    "clinical_history": "Emma is a 32-year-old lawyer who has been living with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) for the past 5 years. Emma reports increased fatigue, joint pain, and a characteristic butterfly rash on her face, mainly exacerbated over the past 3/52 due to increased workload and stress. Emma first noted symptoms such as mild joint pain and occasional fevers, which over time progressed to include severe fatigue, noticeable hair loss, and a photosensitive rash. Currently, she struggles most with pain and stiffness in her hands (P1) and knees (P2), exacerbated by her sedentary work environment and long hours at the computer.",

The only minor shortcoming is the placeholder for the image rather than an actual image or a more descriptive substitute, and the past history field is left blank, which could have included more detail.
