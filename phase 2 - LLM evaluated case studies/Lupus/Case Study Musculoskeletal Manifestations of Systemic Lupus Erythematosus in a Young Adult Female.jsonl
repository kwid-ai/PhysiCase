    "title": "Case Study: Musculoskeletal Manifestations of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus in a Young Adult Female",
    "clinical_history": "Maria H., a 28-year-old administrative assistant, presents with a 3-month history of diffuse, intermittent joint pain affecting both hands, wrists, and knees. She complains of pronounced morning stiffness lasting over an hour, often with noticeable swelling of the small joints of her hands. Episodes are more frequent following busy workdays spent typing or after prolonged standing. Maria also reports increased fatigue, occasional low-grade fevers, and a red, butterfly-shaped rash over her cheeks and nose after sun exposure. She denies any recent trauma but notes that her mother was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis in her forties. Past consultations have involved non-specific joint pain, but current symptoms are more persistent and severe. Recent bloodwork confirmed a positive ANA and anti-dsDNA, consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus.",

    "imaging": "Plain radiographs of hands and knees show no erosions; soft tissue swelling present in small joints of hands. Musculoskeletal ultrasound reveals mild synovitis in MCP and PIP joints.",
