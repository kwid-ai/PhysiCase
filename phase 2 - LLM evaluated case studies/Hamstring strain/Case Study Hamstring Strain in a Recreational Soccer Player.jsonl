    "title": "Case Study: Hamstring Strain in a Recreational Soccer Player",
    "clinical_history": "A 28-year-old male recreational soccer player presented with a hamstring strain injury. He reported that during a soccer game 3 days prior to presentation, he experienced a sudden onset of sharp pain in the back of his thigh while sprinting. He heard a 'pop' and felt a severe pulling sensation in his hamstring. Since then, he has been experiencing pain and stiffness in the affected area, making it difficult for him to walk and perform daily activities.",

    "picture": "A 24-hour pain picture shows that the pain is constant, with an increase in pain during activities and at night",
    "easing_factors": "rest, ice, and compression; relieved by activities that involve relaxation and stretching of the hamstring muscle",
    "past_history": "previous history of minor hamstring strains, but nothing severe; has a history of inadequate warm-up and stretching before playing soccer",
    "medical_history": "generally healthy, but has a history of mild hypertension; no previous surgeries",
    "medications": "none, but uses over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen for pain management",
    "personal_history": "married with two children; works as an accountant and plays soccer recreationally 2-3 times a week",
    "imaging": "MRI of the affected thigh showed a grade 2 hamstring strain in the biceps femoris muscle",
