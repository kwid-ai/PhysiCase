    "clinical_history": "John is a 45-year-old tennis coach at a local club. He has been coaching tennis for over 10 years and has recently increased his coaching load.  About 6 weeks ago, he started to notice a gradual onset of pain on the lateral aspect of his right elbow, which has progressively worsened. The pain is more pronounced when he is coaching and hitting backhands. He reports that he has not changed his technique but has been using a new racket with a slightly different grip size. He has also been playing more frequently, often coaching 6 days a week.",
