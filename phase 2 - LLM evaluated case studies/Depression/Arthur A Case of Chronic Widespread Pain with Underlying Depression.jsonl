    "title": "Arthur: A Case of Chronic Widespread Pain with Underlying Depression",
    "clinical_history": "Arthur is a 62-year-old recently retired accountant who presents to physical therapy with a referral from his General Practitioner for 'chronic widespread pain.' The onset has been insidious over the past 4-5 months, coinciding with his retirement. He describes a constant, deep, heavy ache that feels 'everywhere,' but is most prominent in his neck, upper back, and low back. He reports profound fatigue and a lack of energy that makes even simple tasks feel monumental. His wife prompted the visit, noting his increasing withdrawal from social activities, loss of interest in his hobbies (formerly an avid golfer), and generally depressed mood. Arthur himself admits to feeling 'useless' and 'rudderless' since leaving his lifelong career. He finds it difficult to get out of bed in the morning due to both pain and a complete lack of motivation.",

            "affected_area": "Chronic, widespread, symmetrical aching pain. Primarily affecting the cervical paraspinals, upper trapezius, and lumbar erector spinae. The sensation is described as a 'deep, heavy ache' and 'all-over stiffness.'",
            "score": "3-7"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Prolonged static postures (sitting or lying > 30 minutes), attempts at physical activity (e.g., walking more than 10-15 minutes, household chores), stressful situations, and poor sleep. He notes the pain and fatigue are significantly worse during periods of low mood.",
    "picture": "[insert image of a person highlighting the posterior neck, upper shoulders/trapezius region, and the full lumbar spine bilaterally]",
    "easing_factors": "Short periods of rest can temporarily reduce the intensity, but stiffness increases. A warm shower offers transient relief for about an hour. He notes that distraction can sometimes help him forget the pain, but he has difficulty engaging in activities to achieve this.",
    "past_history": "History of intermittent, self-limiting episodes of mechanical low back pain throughout his career, which he always attributed to 'sitting at a desk all day.' These episodes would typically resolve within a week or two with over-the-counter anti-inflammatories.",
    "medical_history": "Major Depressive Disorder (formally diagnosed 2 months ago), Hypertension (well-controlled).",
    "medications": "Sertraline 50mg daily (initiated 6 weeks ago), Lisinopril 10mg daily, Naproxen 500mg PRN (reports it 'barely touches the pain').",
    "personal_history": "Married, lives with his supportive but admittedly strained wife. Retired 5 months ago after a 40-year career at the same accounting firm. He has lost contact with most work colleagues and has stopped attending his weekly golf club meetups. Reports anhedonia, poor sleep quality (difficulty with sleep onset and maintenance), and a significantly reduced appetite over the past few months.",
    "imaging": "Lumbar Spine MRI (dated 1 month prior): Report indicates 'moderate multilevel degenerative disc disease and facet arthropathy, most pronounced at L4-S1.' The findings are noted as being consistent with age-related changes, with no significant central canal stenosis or neural foraminal narrowing to account for his global symptom presentation.",
