    "condition": "Calf muscle tear",
    "title": "Acute Medial Gastrocnemius Tear in a Recreational Tennis Player",
    "clinical_history": "John M., a 42-year-old recreational tennis player, experienced a sudden sharp pain in his right calf while pushing off for a serve during a weekend tennis match. He reported an audible 'pop' at the moment of injury, followed by immediate weakness and an inability to continue play. Swelling and bruising developed over the medial aspect of his calf within a few hours. John has difficulty weight-bearing on the affected leg and describes a persistent ache at rest with sharp, stabbing pain on attempted walking, especially during push-off. He denied any prior similar injuries but reports occasional calf tightness after longer matches. John works as a software engineer, typically sedentary during the week, and plays tennis 1-2 times per week to maintain fitness.",
