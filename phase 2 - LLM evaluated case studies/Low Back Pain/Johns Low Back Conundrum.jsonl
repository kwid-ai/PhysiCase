    "title": "John's Low Back Conundrum",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 45-year-old software engineer who spends the majority of his day working at a computer. Over the past 3 months, he has experienced intermittent low back pain that has become progressively more disruptive. He first noticed the pain after an intense week of meeting project deadlines, during which he spent prolonged hours seated at his desk. The pain is described as a dull ache, located in the lower lumbar region, which sometimes radiates into the right buttock (P2). The pain is worse in the morning and tends to ease off slightly by midday but becomes frustratingly persistent by late afternoon. ",
