    "clinical_history": "Meet John, a 42-year-old office worker who has been experiencing chronic low back pain for the past 6 months. He reports that the pain started gradually, with no specific incident or trauma. John spends most of his day sitting at a desk, working on a computer, and has a sedentary lifestyle.
