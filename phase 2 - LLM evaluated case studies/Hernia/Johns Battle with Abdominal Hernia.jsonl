    "title": "John's Battle with Abdominal Hernia",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 45-year-old software engineer who spends most of his day seated in front of a computer. He started noticing a mild discomfort in his lower abdomen about a month ago, which gradually progressed to pain especially when lifting heavy objects or coughing. He observes a noticeable bulge on the right side of his groin, which reduces when he is lying down. His symptoms worsen when he stands for prolonged periods or during physical exertion. He consumed over-the-counter pain relievers with minimal relief.",

    "past_history": "Had an appendectomy 10 years ago and experienced minor complications post-surgery such as infections. No significant complaints until the onset of the current symptoms.",
    "medical_history": "John has been diagnosed with hypertension and has been managing it with lifestyle changes rather than medication. He is generally healthy, with stable vitals.",
    "medications": "Occasionally uses over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen.",
    "personal_history": "John lives a sedentary lifestyle, often working long hours at his desk job without sufficient breaks for physical activity. He is married with two school-going children and spends leisure time either with his family or on computer-based hobbies.",
    "imaging": "A recent abdominal ultrasound confirmed the presence of an inguinal hernia on the right side.",
