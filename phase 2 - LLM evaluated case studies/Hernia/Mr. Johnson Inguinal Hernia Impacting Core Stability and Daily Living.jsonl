    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel Johnson is a 48-year-old warehouse manager who reports a progressive bulge in his right lower abdomen for the past 3 months. He noticed mild discomfort after lifting a heavy box at work but had no sudden, sharp pain. Over the last 4 weeks, he has experienced intermittent aching localized to the right inguinal region, exacerbated by physical exertion, coughing, or prolonged standing. His pain subsides at rest or when lying supine. On examination, a palpable, reducible mass is noted in the right inguinal region, which becomes prominent with Valsalva maneuver. He denies any nausea, vomiting, or systemic symptoms.",
