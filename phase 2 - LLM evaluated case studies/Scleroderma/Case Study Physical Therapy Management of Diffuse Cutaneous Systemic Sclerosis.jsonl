    "title": "Case Study: Physical Therapy Management of Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis",
    "clinical_history": "The patient is a 48-year-old female, Mrs. Eleanor Vance, a former librarian who was referred to physical therapy for management of progressive joint stiffness, pain, and functional decline. Mrs. Vance was diagnosed with diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (dcSSc) two years ago, following a preceding one-year history of severe Raynaud's phenomenon and puffy hands. The onset of her skin thickening was rapid, progressing from her fingers and hands proximally to involve her forearms, upper arms, and trunk within the first 18 months post-diagnosis. She presents today complaining of significant difficulty with activities of daily living, particularly dressing, meal preparation, and personal hygiene, due to severe hand and wrist contractures and generalized weakness. Her chief complaint is a feeling of being 'imprisoned' by her own skin, coupled with debilitating joint pain.",

        {
            "context": "P1",
            "affected_area": "Bilateral hands, wrists, and elbows; described as a constant, deep, burning ache with severe stiffness.",

            "context": "P2",

            "score": "8-9"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Any activity requiring fine motor control (e.g., buttoning a shirt, using utensils), gripping, or sustained reaching. Exposure to cold temperatures, which triggers severe vasospasm (Raynaud's). Prolonged periods of inactivity, which markedly increase morning stiffness. Stress is also reported to exacerbate her symptoms.",
    "picture": "The primary pathology is widespread fibrosis of connective tissues. This affects the skin (causing thickening and tightening), subcutaneous tissue, and synovium of the joints. In Mrs. Vance's case, this has led to significant flexion contractures of the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints of the hands, as well as reduced range of motion in the wrists, elbows, and to a lesser extent, the shoulders. Muscle atrophy is secondary to disuse and the restrictive effect of the overlying sclerotic skin.",
    "easing_factors": "Gentle, prolonged stretching after a warm shower. Paraffin wax baths for her hands provide temporary relief from stiffness and pain. Pacing activities throughout the day. Consistent use of prescribed medications.",
    "past_history": "Diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon three years ago. Otherwise, she had an unremarkable medical history prior to the onset of scleroderma. No history of significant musculoskeletal injuries or surgeries.",
    "medical_history": "Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc), confirmed by positive anti-Scl-70 antibody test. Secondary Raynaud's phenomenon. Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a common complication. Mild interstitial lung disease, monitored by a pulmonologist.",
    "medications": "Methotrexate (immunosuppressant), Nifedipine (calcium channel blocker for Raynaud's), Omeprazole (for GERD), and over-the-counter NSAIDs as needed for pain, though with limited effect.",
    "personal_history": "Mrs. Vance lives with her supportive husband in a single-story home. She was forced to take early retirement from her job as a librarian due to her functional limitations. She expresses significant frustration and symptoms of depression related to her loss of independence and inability to engage in her hobbies, which included piano playing and gardening. Her primary goal for therapy is to regain enough hand function to perform basic self-care independently.",
    "imaging": "Recent hand X-rays show soft tissue swelling and resorption of the terminal phalangeal tufts (acro-osteolysis), consistent with scleroderma. A recent high-resolution CT (HRCT) of the chest confirmed early, stable signs of interstitial lung disease.",
