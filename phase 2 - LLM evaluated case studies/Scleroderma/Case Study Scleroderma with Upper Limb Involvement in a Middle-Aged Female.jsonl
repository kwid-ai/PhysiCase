    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Anita Deshmukh is a 47-year-old accountant presenting with increasing tightness and pain in her hands, fingers, and forearms for the past 18 months. She reports progressive difficulty gripping objects, stiffness on waking that improves marginally by mid-morning, and occasional swelling of her fingers. She describes Raynaud's phenomenon with her fingers becoming pale and painful in cold environments, lasting from several minutes to up to an hour. Her skin appears shiny and thickened over the hands, wrists, and distal forearms. She has also noticed small digital ulcers on the tips of two fingers over the last 4 months. She complains of primary pain and functional limitation in the hands, with secondary aching in the forearms from overuse and compensatory movement.",

    "medications": "Nifedipine (for Raynaud's), omeprazole (for GERD), amlodipine (for mild hypertension), regular use of topical emollients and silicone-based dressings for digital ulcers. Occasional NSAIDs for pain relief.",
    "personal_history": "Married, with two teenage daughters. Non-smoker, drinks alcohol socially. Previously very active; reduced hobbies such as gardening and knitting due to pain and dexterity issues. Lives in a joint family home. Reports moderate emotional stress due to chronic illness and its effect on work productivity.",
