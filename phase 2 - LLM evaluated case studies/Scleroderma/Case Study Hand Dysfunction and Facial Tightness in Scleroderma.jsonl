    "title": "Case Study: Hand Dysfunction and Facial Tightness in Scleroderma",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Anita Sharma is a 49-year-old accountant who presented with a 1-year history of progressive tightening and thickening of the skin on her hands and face. She reports significant stiffness in the mornings, difficulty making a fist, and increasing trouble performing daily tasks such as buttoning shirts or typing. Over the past 3 months, she noticed her fingers becoming pale and painful with cold exposure, followed by redness and swelling (Raynaud's phenomenon). She also describes mild aching in her wrists and occasional shortness of breath with exertion.",

        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Cold exposure (provokes hand pain, worsens Raynaud's episodes), prolonged gripping or repetitive hand movements (increases aching and stiffness), early morning hours (more pronounced hand tightness).",
    "picture": "Patient highlights pain and tightness predominantly over both hands (especially fingers), with noted perioral and cheek skin thickening.",
    "easing_factors": "Gentle hand exercises, warm water soaks, and wearing thermal gloves improve symptoms. Paracetamol provides mild relief. Symptoms ease slightly after 1-2 hours of activity in the morning.",
    "past_history": "No significant joint or skin issues prior to onset. No recent trauma or surgeries.",
    "medical_history": "Recent onset gastroesophageal reflux symptoms; otherwise no known chronic illnesses. No significant allergic history.",
    "medications": "Calcium channel blocker (nifedipine) for Raynaud's phenomenon, Paracetamol for pain as needed, Omeprazole for reflux.",
    "personal_history": "Non-smoker, minimal alcohol use. Married, lives with spouse, two adult children living independently. Reduced participation in hobbies (knitting, gardening) due to hand dysfunction.",
    "imaging": "Hand X-rays reveal mild joint contractures, no erosions. Nailfold capillaroscopy shows dilated capillary loops suggestive of scleroderma.",
