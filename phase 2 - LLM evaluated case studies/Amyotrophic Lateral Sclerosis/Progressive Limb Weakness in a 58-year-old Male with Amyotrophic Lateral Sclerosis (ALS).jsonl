    "title": "Progressive Limb Weakness in a 58-year-old Male with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Stephen Harris is a 58-year-old retired mechanical engineer who presents with an 8-month history of progressive weakness and muscle wasting, initially starting in the right hand and gradually involving both upper and lower limbs. The patient noticed increasing difficulty with fine motor tasks such as buttoning his shirt and gripping tools, followed by frequent tripping while walking. In the last 2 months, Stephen has experienced slurred speech and mild difficulty swallowing liquids. He denies sensory loss or bladder/bowel involvement. His wife reports muscle twitching in his arms and legs, and noticeable weight loss over the past 6 months. There is no family history of neurodegenerative disease.",
