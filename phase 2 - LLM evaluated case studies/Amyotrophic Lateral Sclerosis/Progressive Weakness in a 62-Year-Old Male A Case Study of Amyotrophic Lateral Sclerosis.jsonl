    "title": "Progressive Weakness in a 62-Year-Old Male: A Case Study of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. David Chen, a 62-year-old retired civil engineer, presents to our outpatient physical therapy clinic with a referral from his neurologist. He received a diagnosis of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) three months ago, confirmed through clinical examination and electromyography (EMG). The onset of his symptoms was insidious, beginning approximately 10 months prior when he first noticed persistent twitching (fasciculations) in his left calf and a subtle weakness in his right hand. Initially, he attributed this to 'getting older', but the symptoms progressed. He began dropping his pen, fumbling with keys, and found it challenging to button his shirts. Over the next six months, the weakness spread, affecting his entire right arm and subsequently his left leg, resulting in foot drop and an increased frequency of tripping. More recently, Mr. Chen has noted changes in his speech, which has become more slurred and nasal (dysarthria), especially when fatigued. He also reports occasional coughing and choking spells during meals, indicative of early dysphagia. His primary goals for therapy are to maintain his current level of function for as long as possible, establish a safe home exercise program, and get recommendations for adaptive equipment.",

            "context": "P2",
            "affected_area": "Secondary musculoskeletal pain in the left shoulder (glenohumeral joint). Described as a deep, constant ache. This is likely due to developing glenohumeral subluxation from progressive weakness of the rotator cuff and deltoid muscles, leading to traction on the joint capsule.",
            "score": "4-7"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Any form of sustained physical activity, such as walking more than 100 meters, aggravates generalized fatigue and lower limb weakness. Fine motor tasks (writing, using utensils) worsen hand fatigue and cramping. Maintaining the left arm in an unsupported, dependent position increases the shoulder ache. Prolonged speaking worsens dysarthria.",
    "picture": "The pathology of ALS involves the progressive degeneration of both upper motor neurons (in the brain) and lower motor neurons (in the brainstem and spinal cord). This leads to the denervation and subsequent atrophy of voluntary muscles throughout the body. Affected muscle groups in this case include: Intrinsic hand muscles, forearm extensors/flexors, tibialis anterior, gastrocnemius-soleus complex, deltoid, rotator cuff, and bulbar muscles (tongue, pharynx, larynx).",
    "easing_factors": "Regular periods of rest and energy conservation techniques. Gentle, passive range of motion exercises for the limbs. Use of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) on the left leg to manage foot drop, which improves gait safety. Proper positioning of the left arm with pillows or an arm trough when seated reduces shoulder pain.",
    "past_history": "Mr. Chen has been generally healthy for most of his life. He had an appendectomy at age 25 and a right knee arthroscopy for a meniscal tear at age 51, with a full recovery. He maintained a moderately active lifestyle prior to the onset of symptoms.",
    "medical_history": "Hypertension, diagnosed 8 years ago, well-controlled with medication. Hyperlipidemia, diagnosed 5 years ago. No history of diabetes, autoimmune disorders, or other neurological conditions.",
    "medications": "Riluzole (Rilutek) 50mg twice daily (for ALS). Lisinopril 10mg daily (for hypertension). Atorvastatin 20mg daily (for hyperlipidemia). Baclofen 5mg three times daily as needed for muscle spasticity.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Chen is retired and lives with his wife of 38 years in a two-story home. His wife is his primary caregiver and is very involved in his care. They have two adult children who live out of state. He was an avid woodworker and gardener, hobbies he can no longer participate in due to profound hand weakness and fatigue. The diagnosis has caused significant emotional distress for both Mr. Chen and his wife as they navigate the progressive nature of the disease and the loss of independence.",
    "imaging": "Cervical and Brain MRI were performed 5 months ago to rule out other pathology such as cervical myelopathy or a tumor; results were unremarkable. Nerve Conduction Studies (NCS) and Electromyography (EMG) showed evidence of widespread active and chronic denervation with reinnervation, consistent with a motor neuron disease.",
