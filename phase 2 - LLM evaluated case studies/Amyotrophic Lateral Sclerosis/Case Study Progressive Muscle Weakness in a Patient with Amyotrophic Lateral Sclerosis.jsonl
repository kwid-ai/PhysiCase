He initially noticed difficulty lifting his arm and performing daily activities such as dressing and brushing his teeth. Over time, his symptoms have worsened, and he now experiences weakness in his left arm and both legs. He reports difficulty walking and requires assistance with transfers. He also experiences dysphagia and occasional dysarthria.",
