    "title": "Matthew's Unilateral Neck and Shoulder Pain in the Context of Hodgkin's Lymphoma",
    "clinical_history": "Matthew is a 28-year-old graduate student presenting with a 4-week history of persistent right-sided neck pain, accompanied by intermittent aching extending into the right shoulder and upper trapezius. He notes the insidious onset of a palpable lump above his right clavicle, initially painless, which has since become increasingly tender. Over recent weeks, he has developed mild systemic symptoms including fatigue, nocturnal sweating, and a low-grade fever. The pain worsens with sustained postures (e.g., reading or working at a desk) or when performing heavy lifting at the gym. There is no history of recent trauma, and he denies prior issues involving the neck or shoulder. Examination reveals palpable, firm, non-tender, enlarged right supraclavicular lymph nodes and restricted neck rotation due to discomfort. He is currently awaiting biopsy results.",
