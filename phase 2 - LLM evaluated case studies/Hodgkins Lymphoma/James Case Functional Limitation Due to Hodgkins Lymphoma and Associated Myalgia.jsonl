    "title": "James' Case: Functional Limitation Due to Hodgkin's Lymphoma and Associated Myalgia",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 34-year-old male marketing executive who presented to his primary care physician three months ago with persistent, painless swelling of the left side of his neck and intermittent low-grade fever. Over the ensuing six weeks, he developed increasing fatigue, night sweats, and unexplained weight loss (~6 kg). Approximately four weeks ago, he began to experience a deep, achy pain in his left upper trapezius and surrounding cervical musculature, which worsened after physical exertion or carrying light loads. Additionally, he reports mild aching and stiffness in his proximal humerus on the left. He finds it difficult to engage in his regular fitness routine due to fatigue and muscle soreness, and he occasionally feels tingling sensations radiating to his left arm, especially with overhead activities. Excisional biopsy confirmed classical Hodgkin's lymphoma (nodular sclerosis type), stage II. Chemotherapy (ABVD regimen) commenced three weeks ago.",
