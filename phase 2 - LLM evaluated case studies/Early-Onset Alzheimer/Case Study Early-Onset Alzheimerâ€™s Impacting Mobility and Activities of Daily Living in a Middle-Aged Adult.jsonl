    "clinical_history": "Mark Johnson is a 52-year-old accountant who presented with increased forgetfulness, difficulty in organizing daily tasks, and recent falls at home. He has noticed trouble recalling recent events, misplacing objects, and becoming disoriented in familiar environments. Over the past 6 months, Mark's family has noted a progressive decline in his ability to perform routine tasks such as cooking, managing finances, and attending appointments. Recently, Mark reported experiencing stiffness and weakness in his lower limbs, which has contributed to a shuffling gait and reduced stability. He also complains of intermittent muscle soreness in the lower back and thighs, particularly after longer periods of standing or walking. Although these physical complaints are secondary, they are impacting his independence in activities of daily living. No history of significant trauma, stroke, or orthopedic injury is reported.",
