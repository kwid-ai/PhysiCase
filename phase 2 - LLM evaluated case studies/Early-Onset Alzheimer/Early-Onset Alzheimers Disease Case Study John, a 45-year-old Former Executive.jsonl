    "clinical_history": "John, a 45-year-old former executive, was diagnosed with Early-Onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) 2 years ago. He initially presented with difficulties in word retrieval and spatial navigation. Over time, his symptoms have progressed to include significant memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with daily tasks. He requires assistance with most activities of daily living and has noticeable changes in mood and behavior. Recently, John has been experiencing increased stiffness and rigidity, particularly in the morning, which affects his mobility and balance.",
