    "title": "Case Study: Early Functional Decline in a 48-Year-Old with Early-Onset Alzheimer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel J., a 48-year-old IT project manager, presents with his spouse to the outpatient clinic. Over the past year, he has demonstrated increasing forgetfulness, difficulty managing complex tasks at work, and misplacing items frequently. His spouse notes he has become easily frustrated and has struggled to recognize the purpose of familiar objects. Gradually, he has developed balance issues, subtle unsteadiness when rising from a chair, and increasing difficulty coordinating walking, resulting in near-falls when navigating stairs. His physical complaints are primarily non-painful muscle fatigue in the lower limbs after minimal ambulation. Daniel\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s symptoms have progressively worsened, impacting his capacity for daily self-care activities such as dressing and bathing. He has no known family history of dementia.",

Reports increased anxiety and occasional low mood related to loss of independence and occupational disengagement.",
