    "title": "John's Journey with Parkinson's: Challenges in Daily Mobility",
    "clinical_history": "John is a 68-year-old retired machinist who presented to the physical therapy clinic with progressively worsening slowness of movement, generalized muscular rigidity, and a noticeable resting tremor in his right hand, first identified 18 months ago. Over the past six months, John has noticed increased difficulty with activities of daily living such as getting out of bed, rising from a chair, and turning in confined spaces. His wife notes a shuffling gait and two recent episodes of near-falls when turning quickly. John also reports that his muscles, especially in the neck and upper back, feel stiff and sore at the end of the day. He experiences occasional cramping in his right calf. There is no history of trauma. He denies numbness or weakness, but endorses significant fatigue and a decline in handwriting clarity. Socially, John remains mostly independent but requires assistance with tasks that require fine motor skills.",
