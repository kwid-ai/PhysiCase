    "clinical_history": "Mr. James Johnson is a 48-year-old office manager who has been experiencing neck pain for the past 3 months. His symptoms began gradually and have become progressively worse. The pain is located in the cervical region and occasionally radiates to his left shoulder. Mr. Johnson, an avid golfer, recalls that his pain is more pronounced after a long session of working at his desk during weekdays. On weekends, after playing golf, the pain tends to ease slightly but persists at a lower intensity. He describes the pain as a deep, throbbing sensation, with intermittent sharp twinges.",
