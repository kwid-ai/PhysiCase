    "clinical_history": "A 30-year-old male patient with a history of epilepsy presents with complaints of muscle strain and soreness following a recent seizure episode. The patient reports that during the seizure, he experienced intense muscle contractions and was found on the floor with signs of trauma. He was hospitalized for a short period and is now being followed up as an outpatient. The patient has a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures and has been experiencing increased frequency of seizures over the past year.",
