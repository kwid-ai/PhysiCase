    "clinical_history": "Jake, a 34-year-old construction worker, was brought to the emergency room following a seizure while working on site. Witnesses describe him suddenly stopping work, losing awareness, and experiencing convulsions for around two minutes. Jake recalls feeling a sense of d\u00c3\u00a9j\u00c3\u00a0 vu and a metallic taste in his mouth beforehand, something he has noted over the past month. His wife mentions he has been unusually tired by the end of the day and mentions several instances of him having brief, unresponsive 'daydreams' lasting seconds. Over the past year, Jake reports instances of muscle stiffness and twitches (myoclonus), often in the morning, at least twice a week. Jake is currently experiencing (P1) muscle soreness and stiffness postictally.",
