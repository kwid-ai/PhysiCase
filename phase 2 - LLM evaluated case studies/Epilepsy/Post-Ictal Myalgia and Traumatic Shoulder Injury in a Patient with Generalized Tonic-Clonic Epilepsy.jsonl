    "title": "Post-Ictal Myalgia and Traumatic Shoulder Injury in a Patient with Generalized Tonic-Clonic Epilepsy",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Harrison, a 48-year-old accountant, is referred to physical therapy following a witnessed generalized tonic-clonic seizure two days ago. According to his wife's report, the seizure occurred in their kitchen. He experienced a sudden loss of consciousness, followed by stiffening of his entire body (tonic phase) and subsequent rhythmic jerking of his limbs (clonic phase), lasting approximately 90 seconds. During the fall, he struck his right shoulder against a countertop. Upon regaining consciousness, he was confused and exhausted (post-ictal state) and complained of diffuse, severe body aches and a sharp pain in his right shoulder. He was taken to the Emergency Department where a fracture and dislocation of the shoulder were ruled out. He now presents with (P1) profound, widespread muscle soreness and stiffness, and (P2) a localized, sharp pain in his right shoulder.",

        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Any functional movement aggravates P1, particularly transitional movements like rolling in bed, sit-to-stand, and walking. P2 is aggravated by any attempt to lift the right arm, such as reaching into a cupboard, dressing, or washing his hair. Lying on the right side is impossible.",
    "picture": "",
    "easing_factors": "Complete rest in a supported semi-reclined position offers minimal relief for P1. Application of a cold pack to the right shoulder provides temporary relief for P2. Analgesics provide moderate relief for 2-3 hours.",
    "past_history": "Diagnosed with idiopathic generalized epilepsy 5 years ago. He has experienced 3-4 tonic-clonic seizures per year, typically managed well with medication. This is the first seizure that has resulted in a significant musculoskeletal injury requiring physical therapy. He reports milder, diffuse muscle soreness after previous seizures, but it typically resolved within 24-48 hours without intervention.",
    "medical_history": "Generally in good health aside from the epilepsy. No other significant medical conditions. Allergic to penicillin.",
    "medications": "Levetiracetam 1000mg twice daily for seizure control. Ibuprofen 400mg every 6-8 hours as needed for pain since the incident.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Harrison lives with his wife and two teenage children. He works a sedentary job as an accountant, which is currently in its busy season, leading to increased stress and decreased sleep, which he identifies as potential seizure triggers. He is anxious about the possibility of future seizures causing more severe injury and the impact this may have on his ability to work and provide for his family.",
    "imaging": "X-ray of the right shoulder performed in the Emergency Department was negative for fracture or dislocation. Findings noted mild soft tissue swelling.",
