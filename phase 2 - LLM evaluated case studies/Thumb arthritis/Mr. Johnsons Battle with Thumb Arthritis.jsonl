    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Battle with Thumb Arthritis",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Edward Johnson is a 68-year-old retired carpenter who presents with persistent pain and stiffness in the base of his right thumb. Over the past year, he has noticed increasing difficulty with tasks that involve gripping, pinching, or twisting, such as opening jars or using a screwdriver, which previously were part of his daily routine. The pain is described as a dull ache, which occasionally becomes sharp with specific movements. Swelling at the base of the thumb is noted, along with a noticeable bony enlargement. He is right-handed, and the symptoms are affecting his ability to perform household chores and his favorite hobby, woodworking.",

    "imaging": "Recent X-ray shows joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation at the base of the right thumb, consistent with thumb arthritis.",
