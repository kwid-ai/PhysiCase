    "title": "Margaret's Case of Basal Thumb Arthritis",
    "clinical_history": "Margaret is a 62-year-old retired librarian who presents with a 5-month history of pain and functional limitation at the base of her right thumb. She reports progressively increasing discomfort while performing household activities such as opening jars, turning door handles, and writing. The pain is localized to the base of the thumb, often radiating into the thenar eminence. She describes morning stiffness lasting around 10-15 minutes and swelling at the carpometacarpal (CMC) joint after use. She occasionally notices a grinding sensation during movement. There is no recent trauma, but she recalls a history of frequent, repetitive hand use from years of shelving books. Physical examination reveals tenderness and mild swelling over the first CMC joint, with crepitus and reduced thumb abduction.",

    "past_history": "No significant trauma to the right hand. Last year had mild tendinitis of the right wrist which resolved with rest. No inflammatory arthritis diagnosed.",
    "medical_history": "Mild hypertension, well-controlled with diet and exercise. No diabetes or autoimmune disease reported.",
    "medications": "Occasional use of acetaminophen 500 mg for pain (as needed), no regular NSAIDs due to gastric sensitivity.",
