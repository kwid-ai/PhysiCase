    "title": "Loss of Mobility in an Elderly Male with Lewy Body Dementia",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Arthur Michaels is a 74-year-old retired accountant, brought to the clinic by his daughter due to worsening mobility, recurrent falls, and increasing confusion over the past eight months. Initially, he developed stiffness and mild shuffling when walking, with two minor falls in the past month. He now describes persistent right calf and thigh tightness (P1), with intermittent left shoulder aching (P2) after attempting to support himself when rising from chairs. He sometimes cannot initiate steps (freezing), particularly in unfamiliar or cluttered environments. His family also notes frequent visual hallucinations (seeing small animals or people in the room), fluctuating alertness during the day, and pronounced daytime sleepiness. Pain is worse in the evenings and after periods of inactivity. Patient reports no significant pain at rest. On direct questioning, he struggles to recall details of recent falls but is aware that his gait 'does not feel right.' Morning stiffness improves somewhat with gentle movement.",
