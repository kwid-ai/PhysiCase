    "clinical_history": "A 75-year-old male patient, Mr. Johnson, presents with a 2-year history of progressive cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and fluctuating mental status. He experiences vivid hallucinations, particularly in the evening, and has difficulty with problem-solving, memory, and spatial reasoning. Additionally, he exhibits parkinsonian motor symptoms, including rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. His wife reports that he has difficulty with daily activities, such as dressing and bathing, due to cognitive and motor impairments.",

    "medical_history": "Diagnosed with Lewy Body Dementia 2 years ago, with gradual progression of symptoms. He also has a history of urinary incontinence and constipation.",
    "medications": "Rivastigmine, levodopa-carbidopa, and ondansetron for hallucinations and motor symptoms",
    "personal_history": "Married with two adult children. He was a retired accountant and enjoys reading and gardening. He has difficulty with daily activities due to cognitive and motor impairments.",
    "imaging": "An MRI of the brain showed generalized atrophy and decreased dopamine transporter density on DaTSCAN, consistent with Lewy Body Dementia.",

The response is clear and comprehensive, covering clinical history, symptom patterns, aggravating/easing factors, and medication.
