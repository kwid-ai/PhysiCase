    "title": "Graham: A Case of Lewy Body Dementia with Progressive Musculoskeletal Impairment",
    "clinical_history": "Graham is a 70-year-old retired engineer who presented with a two-year history of progressive cognitive decline, vivid visual hallucinations, fluctuating levels of attention, and recent onset of parkinsonian motor features. He reports frequent episodes of muscle stiffness, particularly in the lower limbs and axial muscles, described as a persistent ache with intermittent cramping. He mentions difficulty rising from chairs, shuffling gait, and two recent falls in the past month. His sleep is disturbed due to acting out dreams (REM sleep behavior disorder), and his wife notes increased slowness in movement and occasional tremulousness. Graham finds activities of daily living increasingly challenging, needing assistance with dressing and bathing. He also reports dull pain in his lumbar region, possibly due to his increasingly stooped posture.",
