    "clinical_history": "Sarah Jones is a 38-year-old accountant who presents for physiotherapy due to progressive weakness and fatigue primarily affecting her lower limbs over the past three months. She describes an insidious onset of right leg heaviness, frequent tripping, and occasional left arm numbness. Her initial diagnosis of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis (MS) was made eight years ago after an episode of optic neuritis. At present, she reports muscle spasms, balance difficulties, and increased clumsiness\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially after periods of prolonged activity or in hot environments. Gait instability and spasticity have recently contributed to a fall at home, though there were no serious injuries. She is concerned about maintaining her independence and keeping up with her two school-aged children.",

    "imaging": "MRI brain and spine (six months ago): Multiple periventricular, juxtacortical, and spinal lesions consistent with demyelination. Increased high T2 signal in cervical spinal cord.",
