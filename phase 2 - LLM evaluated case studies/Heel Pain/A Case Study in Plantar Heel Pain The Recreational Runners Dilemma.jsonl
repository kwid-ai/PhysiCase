    "clinical_history": "Mr. Graham Bennett, a 48-year-old software engineer, presents to the clinic with a chief complaint of insidious onset right heel pain, which began approximately 6 weeks ago. He reports no specific trauma or incident that initiated the symptoms. The pain is localized to the plantar-medial aspect of his right heel and is most pronounced with the first few steps in the morning, describing it as a sharp, 'stone bruise' sensation. After about 10-15 minutes of walking, the pain subsides to a dull ache. Mr. Bennett recently started a new fitness regimen_ a 'couch to 5k' running program_ to improve his health and has been running 3-4 times per week on pavement. He notices the pain is significantly exacerbated during and after his runs. His work is primarily sedentary, but he experiences a marked increase in pain when rising from his desk after prolonged periods of sitting. He has attempted to manage the symptoms with over-the-counter pain relievers and by purchasing new, 'more cushioned' running shoes, with minimal relief.",

    "easing_factors": "Short periods of rest (pain returns on resuming activity). Gentle calf and foot stretching (provides temporary relief). Wearing supportive sneakers with good arch support. Application of ice to the heel after activity.",
    "past_history": "No prior history of significant foot or ankle pathology. Reports a minor left ankle sprain approximately 10 years ago, which resolved fully with no residual deficits.",

    "personal_history": "Mr. Bennett is a married father of two high-school-aged children. He works long hours at a desk, often sitting for 2-3 hours at a time. His recent motivation to run stems from a desire to lose approximately 20 pounds and improve cardiovascular health. His typical work footwear consists of leather dress shoes with minimal support, and he often walks barefoot around his home.",
