    "clinical_history": "Jessica M., a 29-year-old marketing executive, presents with a 5-month history of right-sided jaw pain accompanied by intermittent ear discomfort and fullness. The pain began insidiously, initially noted as mild aching in the TMJ region with increased computer work and periods of high stress at her job. She reports pain worsening with prolonged speaking, chewing tough foods, and during periods of emotional stress. Occasionally, she experiences a clicking sensation in her jaw without any episodes of locking or dislocation. Jessica also describes intermittent tinnitus in the right ear and difficulty sleeping on her right side due to discomfort. There is no history of recent dental procedures or facial trauma.",
