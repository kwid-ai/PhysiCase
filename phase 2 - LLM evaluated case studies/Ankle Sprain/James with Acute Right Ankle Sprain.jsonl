    "title": "James with Acute Right Ankle Sprain",
    "clinical_history": "James, a 34-year-old construction worker, was playing a recreational basketball game last weekend. While attempting to defend an opposing player, he landed awkwardly on his right foot resulting in excessive inversion of the ankle. He immediately felt a sharp pain and was unable to continue playing, having to be helped to the sideline. The ankle began to swell significantly within an hour, and by the following morning, there was notable bruising around the lateral aspect of his ankle. James reports persistent pain when trying to bear weight, and he notices instability or a 'rolling' sensation when attempting to walk.",
