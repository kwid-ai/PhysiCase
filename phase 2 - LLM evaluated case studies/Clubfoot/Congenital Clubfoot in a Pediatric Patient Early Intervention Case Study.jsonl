    "clinical_history": "Matteo is a 4-month-old male infant referred by his pediatrician after his parents noted an abnormal appearance of his right foot since birth, with persistent inward and downward turning despite gentle manipulation. The family history is negative for congenital deformities, but his mother had limited prenatal care. On examination, the right foot presents with equinus (plantar flexion at ankle), varus (inward tilt of heel), adduction of the forefoot, and cavus (high medial longitudinal arch). The posterior tibial tendon, tibialis anterior, and Achilles tendon on the affected side are noticeably taut. No other limb abnormalities are present. The child is otherwise healthy, feeding well, and reaching developmental milestones.",
