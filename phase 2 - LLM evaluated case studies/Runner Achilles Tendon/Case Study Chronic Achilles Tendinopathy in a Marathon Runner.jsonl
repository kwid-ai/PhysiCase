    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Achilles Tendinopathy in a Marathon Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mark L., a 38-year-old competitive marathon runner, presents with a 3-month history of gradually worsening pain and stiffness in his right Achilles tendon. Symptoms began after increasing his weekly running mileage in preparation for a marathon. He reports initial morning stiffness that improves after a few steps, but the pain intensifies during the later stages of his runs, especially when training on hilly terrain. Mark denies any specific injury but recalls minor discomfort after a sprint session. Over time, he noticed swelling and occasional crepitus along the tendon. He is particularly concerned about decreased push-off power and mild limping after long runs. Mark has started skipping training sessions and is frustrated by his slow recovery.",
