    "clinical_history": "James is a 32-year-old professional marathon runner. He initially started experiencing discomfort in his right Achilles tendon after an intense hill training session 4 weeks ago. At first, the pain was mild and present only after running. However, over the past week, it has intensified and is now persistent, especially prominent upon waking up in the morning. He describes it as a dull ache with occasional sharp stinging when he tries to do speed work or hill repeats. The pain is affecting his stride and is accompanied by stiffness, particularly in the mornings.",
