    "clinical_history": "David is a 38-year-old male, consistently running 40-50 km per week for the past 10 years. Over the last month, he has noted gradually worsening pain and stiffness at the back of his right ankle, most pronounced on rising in the morning and after intervals or hill sprints. He recalls no specific injury but does mention recently increasing his weekly mileage and incorporating more speed work. The pain is centered over the mid-portion of the Achilles tendon, with mild swelling and tenderness noted. He reports difficulty with pushing off during runs and discomfort when descending stairs. There is no history of systemic symptoms, trauma, or past similar issues in this area.",
