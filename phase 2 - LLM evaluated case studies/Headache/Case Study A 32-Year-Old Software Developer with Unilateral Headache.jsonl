    "title": "Case Study: A 32-Year-Old Software Developer with Unilateral Headache",
    "clinical_history": "Mark is a 32-year-old software developer who presents with a gradual onset of right-sided headaches over the past 6 months. He cannot recall a specific incident or injury. The onset coincides with a high-stakes project at work, requiring him to work 10-12 hours daily at his desk. He describes the primary complaint (P1) as a persistent, dull, nagging ache that begins at the base of his skull on the right side and 'wraps' around his head to the temple and, occasionally, behind his right eye. He denies any visual disturbances, aura, or nausea typically associated with migraines. His secondary complaint (P2) is a general stiffness and ache across his upper shoulders and neck. The headache makes it difficult for him to concentrate, leading to decreased productivity and increased irritability. He finds himself avoiding quick head movements, particularly turning to the right, as it can provoke a sharp zing of pain.",

    "easing_factors": "Lying down flat without a pillow for 15-20 minutes, applying a heat pack to his neck and shoulders, taking short breaks to walk around, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatories.",
    "past_history": "Mark was involved in a minor rear-end motor vehicle accident approximately 5 years ago. He experienced neck stiffness for 2-3 weeks which resolved on its own without requiring formal physical therapy or medical intervention. He has a history of occasional, self-limiting episodes of a 'stiff neck' after sleeping in an awkward position.",
    "medical_history": "Generally healthy and well. Reports no history of true migraines, visual deficits, or systemic inflammatory conditions. All neurological screening questions are negative.",
    "medications": "Ibuprofen (Advil) 200-400mg, as needed, approximately 3-4 times per week. Reports it 'takes the edge off' but does not fully resolve the headache.",
    "personal_history": "Works as a software developer, a role that is primarily sedentary. His home office setup is a standard desk and chair, not professionally assessed for ergonomics. He used to play basketball twice a week but has ceased all recreational sports in the last 4 months due to his demanding work schedule. Reports a significant increase in perceived stress and a decrease in sleep quality since the project began. He lives alone.",
    "imaging": "Cervical spine X-rays were performed 2 months ago by his general practitioner. The report was largely unremarkable, noting 'mild degenerative changes at C5-C6,' which were deemed normal for his age.",
