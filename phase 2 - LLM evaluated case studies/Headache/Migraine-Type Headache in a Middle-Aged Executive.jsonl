    "clinical_history": "Mr. Jonathan Li is a 42-year-old male, working as a senior finance manager at a multinational firm. He presented with complaints of recurring headaches for the past 8 months, gradually increasing in frequency and intensity. The headaches are typically unilateral, starting above the right eye and radiating to the right temple and occiput. He describes the pain as throbbing and moderate-to-severe in intensity. The headaches are often accompanied by photophobia, phonophobia, and occasional nausea, but no vomiting. The pain is usually worse in the late afternoon, especially after prolonged screen time, meetings, or periods of high stress. Notably, he reports increased pericranial muscle tenderness, particularly in the upper trapezius and suboccipital region on the right. He denies aura or visual disturbances. Sleep is interrupted by headache on 1-2 nights per week. OTC analgesics provide some relief.",
