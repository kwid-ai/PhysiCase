    "clinical_history": "A 35-year-old male, John, presented with complaints of progressive muscle stiffness and wasting, particularly in the distal muscles of his arms and legs. He reported difficulty releasing his grip after shaking hands or holding objects, and experienced myotonia, characterized by delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction. He also complained of fatigue, muscle weakness, and difficulty swallowing. John's symptoms have been worsening over the past 5 years, with a significant impact on his daily activities and quality of life.",
