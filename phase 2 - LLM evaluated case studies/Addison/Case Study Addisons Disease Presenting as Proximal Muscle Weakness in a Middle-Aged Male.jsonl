    "title": "Case Study: Addison's Disease Presenting as Proximal Muscle Weakness in a Middle-Aged Male",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel Roberts, a 48-year-old accountant, presented with progressive fatigue, muscle weakness, and diffuse myalgia over the past 3 months. He reports generalized muscle aches, but the most troublesome complaint is difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs due to weakness in his thighs and hips. He has an unintentional weight loss of 5 kg over the last two months, significant morning lethargy, and darkening of the skin over his knuckles and oral mucosa. He describes joint discomfort in his knees and lower back, but denies any history of trauma. There are episodes of dizziness, especially when standing up quickly, and occasional nausea and abdominal discomfort. He reports that these symptoms are worse late in the day and particularly after physical activity. He denies fever or recent illnesses.",

    "medications": "Currently not on any prescribed medications. Uses OTC ibuprofen occasionally for muscle or joint aches. No corticosteroid therapy previously.",
    "personal_history": "Lives with spouse and two teenage children. Non-smoker, minimal alcohol. Sedentary lifestyle attributed to work and recent onset of significant fatigue and muscle weakness. Has become less socially active due to malaise.",
    "imaging": "No imaging performed to date. Laboratory investigations expected to reveal low sodium, high potassium, and low serum cortisol.",
