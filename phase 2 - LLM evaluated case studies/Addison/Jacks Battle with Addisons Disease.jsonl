    "clinical_history": "Jack is a 48-year-old civil engineer who presented to the clinic with generalized weakness, fatigue, and episodes of lightheadedness. Over the past 4 months, Jack has noticed these symptoms have become progressively worse, especially in the late afternoon and evening. He also reported noticeable weight loss, decreased appetite, and unexplained darkening of his skin, particularly around his joints and sun-exposed areas. These symptoms have impacted his ability to work effectively on-site, and he has also started avoiding social interactions due to severe fatigue.",
