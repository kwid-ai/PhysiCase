    "title": "Mr. Johnson's Battle with Chronic Knee Pain",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Johnson is a 62-year-old retired civil engineer who has been experiencing worsening knee pain over the past 18 months. He reports that he initially felt a dull ache in his right knee, particularly after longer walks or standing for extended periods. Over time, the pain has intensified and become more constant, now presenting as sharp twinges that follow periods of inactivity, such as sitting for longer than an hour. He experiences stiffness in the knee upon awakening in the morning, which gradually improves through the day. Mr. Johnson also notes swelling around the knee joint, which can sometimes last for a few days after flare-ups, especially after activities that strain the joint.",
