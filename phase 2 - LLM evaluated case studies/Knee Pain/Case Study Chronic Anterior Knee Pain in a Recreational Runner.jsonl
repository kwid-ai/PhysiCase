    "title": "Case Study: Chronic Anterior Knee Pain in a Recreational Runner",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. David Kim is a 42-year-old male who presents with a 4-month history of gradual onset right anterior knee pain. He is an avid recreational runner, typically covering 20\u00e2\u20ac\u201c30 km each week. The pain began after he increased his weekly mileage in preparation for a half marathon. Initially, David noticed a dull ache around his right patella after longer runs. Over time, the pain became more constant and now occasionally interferes with activities of daily living, such as descending stairs or rising from a chair. He describes his primary pain as an ache at the front of his knee (P1) and, less frequently, a secondary pain along the lateral side of his knee (P2), which he attributes to compensatory movement patterns. There is no history of trauma, instability, locking, or catching. Swelling is minimal, but he sometimes experiences morning stiffness lasting less than 10 minutes. David works as a software engineer and often sits for long periods, reporting increased discomfort after prolonged sitting (the \u00e2\u20ac\u02dctheater sign\u00e2\u20ac\u2122). He has attempted to manage symptoms with over-the-counter analgesics and by applying ice after runs, with temporary relief. He recently reduced his running volume but is keen to resume his training regimen.",
