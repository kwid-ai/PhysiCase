    "title": "Jake's Battle with Tennis Elbow",
    "clinical_history": "Jake is a 42-year-old software engineer who spends most of his day at a desk. He started experiencing pain on the lateral aspect of his right elbow about three months ago. Jake began a new tennis regimen with increased frequency, playing 4-5 times a week. About a month after the increased activity, he noted a sharp pain in his right elbow after an intense game. The pain appeared with specific movements, such as lifting his coffee mug or typing for extended periods. Jake reports the pain as (P1) a sharp, burning sensation directly at the lateral elbow and (P2) a secondary aching that radiates into his forearm, particularly when gripping objects tightly.",

    "past_history": "No previous elbow or arm injuries. He did, however, experience a rotator cuff injury on the same side two years ago, which was resolved with physical therapy.",
    "medical_history": "Jake is generally healthy with no significant medical issues. He is slightly overweight and has started a lifestyle modification to address this with increased physical activity.",
    "medications": "Ibuprofen 400mg prn for pain management",
    "personal_history": "Jake lives a sedentary lifestyle at work but has been actively trying to become healthier. Married with two children, he dedicates weekends to coaching his children's youth soccer team. No family history of musculoskeletal disorders.",
    "imaging": "None to date, but clinical symptoms point towards lateral epicondylitis.",
