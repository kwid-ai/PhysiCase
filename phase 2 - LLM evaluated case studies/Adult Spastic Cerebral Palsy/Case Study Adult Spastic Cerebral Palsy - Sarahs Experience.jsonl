    "clinical_history": "Sarah is a 35-year-old woman with a history of spastic cerebral palsy. She was born prematurely and had a difficult neonatal period, which led to her diagnosis. As a child, she underwent various treatments, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, and selective dorsal rhizotomy. She has a history of muscle spasms, stiffness, and limited mobility. Sarah has been experiencing increased muscle tone and stiffness in her lower extremities, particularly in her hamstrings and adductors, which has affected her gait and balance. She reports difficulty with transfers and ambulation, requiring the use of a walker for support.",
