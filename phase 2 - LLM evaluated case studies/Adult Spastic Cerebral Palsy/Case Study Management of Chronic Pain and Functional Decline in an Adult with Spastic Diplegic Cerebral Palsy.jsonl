    "title": "Case Study: Management of Chronic Pain and Functional Decline in an Adult with Spastic Diplegic Cerebral Palsy",
    "clinical_history": "David is a 38-year-old male graphic designer who presents to physical therapy with a six-week history of new-onset low back pain (P1) and right-sided radiating leg pain (P2). David has a known diagnosis of spastic diplegic cerebral palsy, which has primarily affected his lower extremities since childhood. He has been functionally independent, living alone and commuting to work via public transport. Approximately two months ago, he initiated a new walking program in an effort to improve his cardiovascular health. Shortly after, he began to notice a dull, persistent ache in his lower back. Over the last few weeks, this has progressed to include a sharp, shooting pain down his right posterior leg. These new symptoms are significantly impacting his ability to tolerate prolonged sitting at his desk, his commute, and his sleep quality. He expresses significant concern over a potential decline in his hard-won independence.",

            "score": "6-8/10"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Prolonged sitting (>20-30 minutes), transitioning from sit-to-stand, walking for more than 5 minutes, ascending stairs, and any maneuvers that increase intra-abdominal pressure such as coughing or sneezing (provokes P2).",
    "picture": "The patient's condition primarily affects the lower extremity musculature. Chronic spasticity and hypertonicity are most pronounced in the bilateral hip adductors, hamstrings (semitendinosus, semimembranosus, biceps femoris), and gastrocnemius-soleus complex. This has led to secondary postural adaptations, including an anterior pelvic tilt and compensatory lumbar hyperlordosis.",
    "easing_factors": "Lying supine with pillows under his knees, short periods of standing and gentle stretching every 20 minutes, application of a heat pack to the low back, and his prescribed muscle relaxant.",
    "past_history": "Diagnosed with spastic diplegic cerebral palsy at age 2 following a premature birth. Underwent bilateral hamstring and Achilles tendon lengthening surgery at age 10 to improve his gait. Received regular physical therapy throughout his childhood and adolescence, which he credits for his current level of function. Has a baseline of chronic muscle stiffness and a characteristic 'scissoring' gait pattern, but this has been stable and manageable until the recent onset of LBP and radicular symptoms.",
    "medical_history": "Lumbar spine X-ray performed one week ago revealed moderate degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 and L5-S1 with accompanying facet joint arthropathy. Otherwise, he is in good general health with no other significant co-morbidities.",
    "medications": "Oral Baclofen 10mg three times daily (long-term for spasticity management). Ibuprofen 400mg as needed for pain, which he reports taking 2-3 times per day for the last month.",
    "personal_history": "David lives alone in a third-floor walk-up apartment and works full-time. His job is largely sedentary. He relies on walking and public transportation. His social activities have become limited due to the increase in pain and fear of exacerbation. He is highly motivated to engage in therapy but is anxious that these new symptoms represent a permanent decline in his functional status.",
    "imaging": "Lumbar Spine X-Ray (1 week prior): Report indicates 'Moderate degenerative changes at L4-L5 and L5-S1, including disc space narrowing and facet joint hypertrophy. No evidence of acute fracture, spondylolisthesis, or instability.'",
