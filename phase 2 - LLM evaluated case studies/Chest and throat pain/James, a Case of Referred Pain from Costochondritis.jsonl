    "clinical_history": "James is a 45-year-old insurance broker who initially started experiencing discomfort in his chest about 3/52 weeks ago. The pain gradually increased to a constant state and began radiating to his throat. The pain is generally described as a sharp, stabbing, or aching sensation right near the sternum but sometimes feels like a dull ache in the throat when at rest. James noted that the pain escalated after an intense workout at the gym where he lifted heavy weights, emphasizing on bench pressing without a warm-up. He has a sedentary lifestyle punctuated by periods of intense physical activity a few times a week. He reports a history of rheumatoid arthritis but has not experienced a recent flare-up.",
