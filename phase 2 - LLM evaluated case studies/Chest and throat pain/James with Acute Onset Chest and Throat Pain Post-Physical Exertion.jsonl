    "title": "James with Acute Onset Chest and Throat Pain Post-Physical Exertion",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 43-year-old warehouse supervisor who reported to the clinic with sudden onset of chest and throat pain following an instance of lifting a heavy box overhead 4 days prior. He describes the pain as a pressure and sharp discomfort centrally in the upper chest radiating to his throat, especially when taking deep breaths, speaking loudly, or swallowing solid foods. There is a noted tenderness along the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles on palpation, with mild swelling noted over the upper sternum. He denies shortness of breath at rest, diaphoresis, or referred pain in the left arm. He is concerned as his symptoms have not improved and he has trouble turning his head to the left without intensifying throat pain.",
