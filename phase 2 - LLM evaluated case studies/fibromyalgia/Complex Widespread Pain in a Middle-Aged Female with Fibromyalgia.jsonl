    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Linda Brown is a 47-year-old administrative assistant who presents with a 4-year history of generalized muscle pain and fatigue. Her primary complaints include persistent, diffuse aching and stiffness in the neck, shoulders, upper and lower back, and hips. The pain is present daily, fluctuates in intensity, and is often accompanied by sleep disturbances, unrefreshing sleep, intermittent headaches, and episodes of 'brain fog' affecting memory and concentration. She reports that the symptoms have slowly worsened over the last year, particularly after a period of heightened work-related stress. She denies significant joint swelling or redness. There is no associated fever, weight loss, or rashes.",
