    "title": "Neuromyelitis Optica Presenting as Subacute Lower Limb Weakness in a Middle-Aged Woman",
    "clinical_history": "Ms. Patricia Gomez is a 43-year-old accountant who presented with sudden onset of severe bilateral leg weakness and numbness. Three weeks ago, she developed blurred vision in her right eye accompanied by ocular pain, which improved partially but not completely. Over the past 7 days, she progressively lost strength in both legs, struggling to stand from sitting and needing a walker for short distances. She describes numbness from her abdomen down and an inability to sense bladder fullness, resulting in two episodes of urinary incontinence. She reports persistent tightness and aching in her lower back, hips, and thighs. No significant trauma or recent illness. Patricia is anxious due to her loss of independence and concerned about keeping up with her work and caring for her teenage son.",
