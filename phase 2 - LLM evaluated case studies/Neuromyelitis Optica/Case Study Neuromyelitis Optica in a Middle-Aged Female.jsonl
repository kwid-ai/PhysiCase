    "title": "Case Study: Neuromyelitis Optica in a Middle-Aged Female",
    "clinical_history": "Mrs. Janet Alvarez is a 42-year-old accountant who presented to the outpatient neurology clinic with complaints of sudden bilateral lower limb weakness and severe central back pain that started seven days ago. Before her admission, she reported progressive blurred vision in her left eye, described as a dark patch, with associated pain during eye movement. Over the last three days, her ability to ambulate has deteriorated rapidly, necessitating the use of a wheelchair. She complains of a tight band-like sensation around her mid-thoracic region and reports urinary retention for the past 48 hours. Neurologic examination reveals profound lower limb weakness (Medical Research Council grade 1/5), marked spasticity, and hyperreflexia bilaterally. Sensory loss to pinprick and vibration is noted below the T6 dermatome. She denies any prior major neurological disorder other than intermittent migraines in her 20s. MRI of the spine demonstrates a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis from T4 to T10. Serum testing is positive for anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies. A diagnosis of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD) is made.",
