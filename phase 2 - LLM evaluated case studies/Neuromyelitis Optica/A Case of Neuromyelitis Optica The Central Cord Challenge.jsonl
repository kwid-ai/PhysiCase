    "title": "A Case of Neuromyelitis Optica: The Central Cord Challenge",
    "clinical_history": "We have a case of a 42-year-old female, Ms. Anya Sharma, a university lecturer, who was referred to inpatient rehabilitation following a 3-week hospital stay. Ms. Sharma presented to the emergency department with a rapid onset of bilateral leg weakness, a 'tight band' sensation around her torso at the level of the diaphragm, and severe, burning pain in her legs and feet. This was accompanied by urinary retention. Her symptoms progressed over 48 hours to include significant weakness in her arms and hands. This is her first major neurological event of this nature, though she reports a transient episode of blurred vision and pain in her right eye two years ago, which resolved spontaneously over a few weeks and was attributed to 'stress'. Upon admission, she was diagnosed with an acute relapse of Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD), confirmed by serology. She is now medically stable and transferred for intensive physical therapy. Her primary goals are to manage her pain and regain enough strength to perform bed mobility and transfers independently.",

            "context": "P1 (Primary)",
            "affected_area": "Constant, diffuse burning and electrical shock-like sensations in both lower extremities from the hips to the toes, and a 'cape-like' distribution over the shoulders and upper arms. This is a neuropathic pain complaint.",

            "context": "P2 (Secondary)",
            "affected_area": "Intermittent, deep aching pain in the shoulder and upper back muscles (trapezius, rhomboids). This is a mechanical pain from overuse during repositioning and transfer attempts.",
            "score": "4-6/10"
        }
    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": "Any movement, however slight, of the lower extremities. Light touch from bedding or clothing (allodynia). Prolonged sitting in her wheelchair aggravates both P1 and P2. Fatigue significantly worsens all symptoms, particularly spasticity and neuropathic pain. Transfers and attempts at upper body dressing.",
    "picture": "Ms. Sharma experiences profound morning stiffness and heightened neuropathic pain upon waking. She requires assistance for all morning care. Her functional stamina is extremely low, limited to approximately 20-30 minutes of therapy before requiring a significant rest period due to overwhelming central fatigue. Pain (P1) is relatively constant throughout the day but has sharp peaks with movement. P2 pain increases with any upper body exertion. Spasms in her lower extremities are frequent and are particularly disruptive to her sleep at night.",
    "easing_factors": "Pharmacological management (Gabapentin, Baclofen). Lying in a supine position with pillows supporting her lower extremities to reduce sensory input and spasticity triggers. Slow, gentle passive range of motion. Energy conservation strategies and scheduled rest periods between activities.",
    "past_history": "An episode of right-sided optic neuritis 2 years ago, characterized by pain with eye movement and blurred central vision. This was not formally diagnosed and resolved over 6 weeks without intervention. Otherwise, she has been in excellent health.",
    "medical_history": "Newly diagnosed with Aquaporin-4 (AQP4-IgG) positive Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder (NMOSD). No other significant comorbidities or surgical history.",
    "medications": "Acute phase treatment in hospital included a 5-day course of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone followed by 7 sessions of plasmapheresis (PEX). Currently on a maintenance regimen of Gabapentin for neuropathic pain, Baclofen for spasticity, and is awaiting initiation of long-term immunosuppressive therapy (Rituximab).",
    "personal_history": "Ms. Sharma is a tenured professor of literature. She lives with her partner in a condominium with elevator access. She is currently on medical leave from her university. She is an avid runner and practices yoga, and she expresses significant distress over her current level of physical dependence and the uncertainty of her prognosis. Her immediate support system is strong, with her partner being actively involved in her care.",
    "imaging": "MRI of the cervical and thoracic spine reveals a longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis (LETM), a T2-hyperintense, gadolinium-enhancing lesion extending contiguously from the C4 to the T2 vertebral levels. Brain MRI is largely unremarkable, which is a key feature distinguishing NMO from Multiple Sclerosis. Serology confirmed the presence of AQP4-IgG antibodies.",
