    "title": "Emily with McArdle Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Emily is a 25-year-old graduate student.  She first noticed symptoms of exercise intolerance and muscle cramps during her college years, particularly during high school gym class or when playing sports.  Over time, she noticed that even simple activities like walking up stairs or doing light exercise would leave her feeling exhausted and with significant muscle pain.  She also reports that she often experiences muscle cramps, stiffness, and weakness, especially in her lower extremities.  Emily has learned to manage her symptoms by adjusting her activity level and eating frequently to maintain energy levels.",
