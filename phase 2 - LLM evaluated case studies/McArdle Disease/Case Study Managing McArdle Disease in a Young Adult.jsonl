    "title": "Case Study: Managing McArdle Disease in a Young Adult",
    "clinical_history": "Meet Emily, a 25-year-old graduate student who has been experiencing muscle cramps, fatigue, and shortness of breath during physical activities. She first noticed these symptoms during her undergraduate studies, particularly during intense exercise sessions or when playing sports. Emily reports that her muscles often feel stiff and sore after exertion, and she has to take regular breaks to rest. She has also noticed that her symptoms worsen in hot weather. Emily's condition was diagnosed as McArdle Disease, a genetic disorder affecting the enzyme myophosphorylase, which is necessary for muscle glycogen breakdown.",

    "past_history": "Emily has a family history of McArdle Disease, with her mother and younger brother also diagnosed with the condition. She has been managing her symptoms with lifestyle modifications and physical therapy.",
    "medical_history": "Emily is generally healthy, with no other significant medical conditions. She takes no medications regularly but uses over-the-counter pain relievers occasionally for muscle soreness.",
