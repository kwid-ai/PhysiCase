    "title": "Case Study: Exercise-Induced Muscle Pain in a Young Adult with McArdle Disease",
    "clinical_history": "Isaac is a 24-year-old university student who presents with complaints of recurrent muscle cramps and profound fatigue during moderate-intensity physical activity, most notably during group sports and brisk walking. He reports that since adolescence, he has been unable to keep pace with his peers during physical education classes, often experiencing severe thigh and calf cramps within 5-10 minutes of exertion. Occasionally, he experiences 'second wind'\u00e2\u20ac\u201dafter resting briefly during activity, his stamina and symptoms improve for a short period. He denies any pain at rest and has not noted significant weakness between episodes, but describes episodes of dark-coloured urine after more strenuous activity, which he now tries to avoid. He works part-time in a library and lives a sedentary lifestyle due to his symptoms.",

The content is highly relevant to McArdle disease, accurately describing hallmark features such as exercise-induced cramps, second wind phenomenon, and myoglobinuria. The response is clear, comprehensive, and clinically accurate, with only a minor shortcoming: the imaging section notes that confirmatory testing is not documented, which could be more explicit about the diagnostic process. Patient safety and clinical accuracy are well addressed.",
