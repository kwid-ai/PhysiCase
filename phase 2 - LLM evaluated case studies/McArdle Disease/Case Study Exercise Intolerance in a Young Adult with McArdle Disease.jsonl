    "title": "Case Study: Exercise Intolerance in a Young Adult with McArdle Disease",
    "clinical_history": "James is a 23-year-old university student who has presented with a lifelong history of marked exercise intolerance. Since childhood, he reports an inability to keep up with his peers during physical education activities. He describes the early onset of fatigue, muscle pain, and cramping, particularly in his thighs and calves, occurring within minutes of starting physical activities such as running, cycling, or climbing stairs. These symptoms are often relieved by brief rest, allowing him to resume activity at a lower intensity (the so-called 'second wind' phenomenon). James reports no loss of consciousness, but he has experienced episodes of dark ('cola-colored') urine after strenuous exercise, suggestive of myoglobinuria, particularly after attempting to walk quickly up several flights of stairs last week. He denies sensory deficits. There is no family history of neuromuscular disease. Physical examination reveals mild muscle tenderness in the proximal lower limbs and no neurological deficits.",

    "aggrevating_factors": "Brief, intense or isometric physical activity (sprinting, weight lifting, stair climbing, carrying heavy bags), prolonged exercise without prior warm-up",
    "picture": "24 Hour Picture: James experiences minimal symptoms at rest and during non-physical activities such as studying or walking short distances at a slow pace. Muscle pain, cramping, and fatigue occur rapidly with onset of moderate exertion, usually within the first 2-5 minutes. Symptoms may subside with short rest intervals, and sometimes he can recommence activity at reduced intensity ('second wind'). Following unaccustomed exertion, James may develop dark urine and significant muscle soreness lasting hours to a day.",
    "easing_factors": "Rest, slow sustained activity after 'second wind', pre-exercise consumption of a carbohydrate-rich snack",
    "past_history": "Childhood diagnosis of exercise intolerance. Several episodes of suspected myoglobinuria following overexertion in gym class, but no history of renal failure or hospital admissions. No traumatic injuries.",
    "medical_history": "No significant comorbidities. Cardiac and neurological investigations unremarkable. Genetic testing confirms McArdle Disease (glycogen storage disease type V, PYGM gene mutation).",
    "medications": "Currently not on regular medication. Advised to take simple analgesia (paracetamol) for post-exertional myalgia as needed. Has tried creatine supplementation in the past without significant benefit.",
    "personal_history": "Non-smoker, does not use alcohol or recreational drugs. Lives in student accommodation. Moderately anxious about physical education assessments and career options due to exercise limitations. Adheres to a balanced diet but limits participation in social sporting events.",
    "imaging": "Muscle biopsy (if performed) would show subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation with absence of myophosphorylase activity. No imaging performed at this time, as clinical and genetic findings are clear.",
