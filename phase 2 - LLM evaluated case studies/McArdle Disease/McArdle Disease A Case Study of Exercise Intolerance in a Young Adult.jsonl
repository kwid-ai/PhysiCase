    "title": "McArdle Disease: A Case Study of Exercise Intolerance in a Young Adult",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Chen is a 22-year-old university student referred to physical therapy following a recent diagnosis of McArdle Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type V). The referral was initiated by his rheumatologist to establish a safe and effective exercise program. The patient reports a lifelong history of profound exercise intolerance, characterized by immediate and severe muscle pain, cramping, and fatigue with any strenuous activity. As a child, he was often labeled as 'unfit' or 'lazy' as he could not keep up with his peers in sports or physical education. He recalls several episodes of coca-cola colored urine following strenuous attempts at play, which were dismissed at the time as severe dehydration. The definitive diagnosis was made 3 months ago after an acute episode of rhabdomyolysis following an attempt to join the university's intramural soccer team. After just a few minutes of sprinting drills, he experienced debilitating pain and weakness in his legs, forcing him to stop. He noted that after about 10 minutes of rest, he was able to jog lightly without pain, a phenomenon he now understands as his 'second wind'. The subsequent myoglobinuria prompted a full workup leading to his diagnosis via a forearm exercise test and genetic confirmation.",

    ],
    "aggrevating_factors": null,
    "picture": "The patient reports feeling generally well on a day-to-day basis, provided he avoids strenuous physical exertion. Mornings are typically symptom-free unless he has overexerted himself the previous day, which results in significant muscle stiffness and soreness (myalgia). His daily life is impacted by architectural barriers; his dormitory is on the third floor with no elevator, making multiple trips per day a planned, slow-paced event. He avoids rushing between classes. Sleep is generally unaffected unless he is experiencing post-exertional myalgia.",
    "easing_factors": "Immediate cessation of the aggravating activity is the primary easing factor. A brief rest interval (5-10 minutes) followed by a gradual return to low-intensity, aerobic activity can elicit a 'second wind,' allowing for prolonged activity with minimal symptoms. A structured, slow-paced warm-up is also crucial. The patient has noted some benefit from consuming a sugary drink 20-30 minutes prior to planned exercise.",
    "past_history": "Lifelong history of exercise intolerance. Multiple episodes of what he now recognizes as mild rhabdomyolysis throughout his childhood and adolescence, which went undiagnosed. He has no history of major trauma, fractures, or surgeries.",
    "medical_history": "Confirmed McArdle Disease (Glycogen Storage Disease Type V). No other significant co-morbidities. Fully vaccinated.",
    "medications": "No prescribed daily medications for McArdle Disease. He occasionally uses Acetaminophen (Tylenol) for post-exertional pain but finds its efficacy limited. He has been cautioned against the use of NSAIDs during episodes of rhabdomyolysis due to the risk of renal complications.",
    "personal_history": "Mr. Chen is an undergraduate engineering student. He is highly intelligent and performs well academically. However, he admits to significant frustration and some social anxiety related to his physical limitations. He has avoided group activities and sports, which has limited his social circle at university. He is motivated to learn how to manage his condition to improve his quality of life and participate more fully in university life.",
    "imaging": "None required for diagnosis. Diagnosis was confirmed via a non-ischemic forearm exercise test (which showed an absent rise in venous lactate) and subsequent genetic testing for PYGM gene mutations.",
