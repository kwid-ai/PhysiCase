    "title": "Rheumatoid Arthritis in a Retired Librarian: Early Morning Stiffness and Functional Decline",
    "clinical_history": "Mr. Daniel Morton is a 62-year-old retired librarian who presents with a 6-month history of progressively worsening joint pain and stiffness, predominantly affecting both hands and wrists. He describes significant morning stiffness lasting over an hour, notably struggling to open jars or button his shirt after waking. He also reports intermittent swelling and pain in both knees. On physical examination, there is visible swelling and tenderness over the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joints, proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, and mild warmth over both wrists. He notices fatigue and occasional low-grade fevers in the afternoon. He has begun to find daily activities, such as gardening and book sorting, increasingly difficult due to reduced grip strength and pain.",
